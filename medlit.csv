A classification of diseases may be defined as a system of categories to which morbid entities are assigned according to established criteria. There are many possible axes of classification and the one selected will depend upon the use to be made of the statistics to be compiled. A statistical classification of diseases must encompass the entire range of morbid conditions within a manageable number of categories.The 10th revision of the International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems is the latest in a series that was formalized in 1893 as the Bertillon classification or International list of causes of death. A complete review of the historical background to the classification is given in V olume 2. While the title has been amended to make clearer the content and purpose and to reflect the progressive extension of the scope of the classification beyond diseases and injuries, the familiar abbreviation ‘ICD’ has been retained. In the updated classification, conditions have been grouped in a way that was felt to be most suitable for general epidemiological purposes and the evaluation of health care.Work on the 10th revision of the ICD started in September 1983 when a Preparatory Meeting on ICD-10 was convened in Geneva. The programme of work was guided by regular meetings of heads of WHO collaborating centres for classification of diseases. Policy guidance was provided by a number of special meetings, including those of the expert committee on the International classification of diseases – 10th revision, held in 1984 and 1987.In addition to the technical contributions provided by many specialist groups and individual experts, a large number of comments and suggestions were received from WHO Member States and regional offices as a result of the global circulation of draft proposals for revision in 1984 and 1986. From the comments received, it was clear that many users wished the ICD to encompass types of data other than the ‘diagnostic information’ (in the broadest sense of the term) that it has always covered. In order to accommodate the perceived needs of these users, the concept arose of a ‘family’ of classifications centred on the traditional ICD with its familiar form and structure. The ICD itself would thus meet the requirement for diagnostic information for general purposes, while a variety of other classifications would be used in conjunction with it and would deal either with different approaches to the same information or with different information (notably medical and surgical procedures and disablement).Following suggestions at the time of development of the ninth revision of the classification that a different basic structure might better serve the needs of the many and varied users, several alternative models were evaluated. It became clear, however, that the traditional single-variable-axis design of 1
Vol1_B&W.indb   1 15/09/15   12:09",4
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESthe classification, and other aspects of its structure that gave emphasis to conditions that were frequent, costly or otherwise of public health importance, had withstood the test of time and that many users would be unhappy with any of the models that had been proposed as a possible replacement.Consequently, as study of the 10th revision will show, the traditional ICD structure has been retained but an alphanumeric coding scheme replaces the previous numeric one. This provides a larger coding frame and leaves room for future revision without disruption of the numbering system, as has occurred at previous revisions.In order to make optimum use of the available space, certain disorders of the immune mechanism are included with diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs (Chapter III). New chapters have been created for diseases of the eye and adnexa, and diseases of the ear and mastoid process. The former supplementary classifications of external causes and of factors influencing health status and contact with health services now form part of the main classification.The dagger and asterisk system of dual classification for certain diagnostic statements, introduced in the ninth revision, has been retained and extended, with the asterisk axis being contained in homogeneous categories at the three-character level.
Content of the three volumes of ICD-10
The presentation of the classification has been changed and there are now three volumes:Volume 1. Tabular list. This contains the Report of the International Conference for the Tenth Revision, the classification itself at the three- and four-character levels, the classification of the morphology of neoplasms, special tabulation lists for mortality and morbidity, definitions, and the nomenclature regulations.Volume 2. Instruction manual. This brings together the notes on certification and classification formerly included in V olume 1, with a good deal of new background and instructional matter and guidance on the use of V olume 1, on tabulations, and on planning for the use of the ICD, which was seen as lacking in earlier revisions. It also includes the historical material formerly presented in the introduction to V olume 1.Volume 3. Alphabetical index. This presents the index itself with an introduction and expanded instructions on its use.* * *The classification was approved by the International Conference for the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases in 1989 and adopted by 2

The periodic revision of the ICD has, since the sixth revision in 1948, been coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO). As the use of the classification has increased, so, understandably, has the desire among its users to contribute to the revision process. The 10th revision is the product of a vast amount of international activity, cooperation and compromise, and WHO acknowledges with gratitude the contributions of the international and national specialist groups and individuals in numerous many countries.WHO gratefully acknowledges the important technical contribution of the WHO Collaborating Centre for the Family of International Classifications which is located at the Deutsches Institut für Medizinische Dokumentation und Information (DIMDI) in Cologne, Germany, and, in particular, that of the Head of the Centre Michael Schopen, in the updating of the texts and the preparation of the electronic files that were used for this version of ICD-10.

Thirteen WHO Collaborating Centres for the Family of International Classifications have been established to assist countries with problems encountered in the development and use of health-related classifications and, in particular, in the use of the ICD.It is important that countries bring to the attention of the respective centre any significant problems they might encounter in the use of the ICD, and especially when a new disease for which the ICD does not provide a suitable classification is encountered frequently. Until now, the ICD has not been updated between revisions but for ICD-10, through the centres, a mechanism has been introduced to provide suitable codes for new diseases where necessary.In addition to the official WHO collaborating centres, there are a number of national reference centres and individual users should first consult these, or their appropriate national office, when they encounter problems.There are three centres for English-language users.

Dr Jardel spoke of the extensive consultations and preparatory work that had gone into the revision proposals and had necessitated a longer than usual interval between revisions. He noted that the 10th revision would have a new title, International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems, to emphasize its statistical purpose and reflect the widening of its scope. The convenient abbreviation ICD would, however, be retained. He also mentioned the new alphanumeric coding scheme, which had made it possible to provide a better balance between the content of the chapters and to leave room for future additions and changes, as well as the intention to produce an ICD manual of three-character categories with an alphabetical index for use where the more complex, detailed four-character version would be inappropriate.The Conference elected the following officers:Dr RHC Wells, Australia (Chairman)  Dr H Bay-Nielsen, Denmark (Vice-Chairman)  Dr R Braun, German Democratic Republic (Vice-Chairman)  Mr RA Israel, United States of America (Vice-Chairman)  Dr  R Laurenti, Brazil (Vice-Chairman) Dr P Maguin, France (Rapporteur)  Ms E Taylor, Canada (Rapporteur).The secretariat of the conference was as follows:Dr JP Jardel, Assistant Director-General, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland  Dr HR Hapsara, Director, Division of Epidemiological Surveillance and Health Situation and Trend Assessment, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland  Dr JC Alary, Chief Medical Officer, Development of Epidemiological and Health Statistical Services, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland  Dr GR Brämer, Medical Officer, Development of Epidemiological and Health Statistical Services, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland (Secretary)  Mr A L’Hours, Technical Officer, Development of Epidemiological and Health Statistical Services, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland Professor W Jänisch, German Democratic Republic (Temporary Adviser)  Mr T Kruse, Denmark (Temporary Adviser)  Dr K Kupka, France (Temporary Adviser)  Dr J Leowski, Poland (Temporary Adviser)  REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE

1. History and development of uses of the 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
The conference was reminded of the impressive history of a statistical classification that dated back to the eighteenth century. While early revisions of the classification had been concerned only with causes of death, its scope had been extended at the sixth revision in 1948 to include non-fatal diseases. This extension had continued through the ninth revision, with certain innovations being made to meet the statistical needs of widely differing organizations. In addition, at the International Conference for the ninth revision (Geneva, 1975) (1), recommendations had been made and approved for the publication, for trial purposes, of supplementary classifications of procedures in medicine and of impairments, disabilities and handicaps.
2. Review of activities in the preparation of 
proposals for the Tenth Revision of the ICD
The proposals before the conference were the product of a vast amount of activity at WHO headquarters and around the world. The programme of work had been guided by regular meetings of the heads of WHO Collaborating Centres for Classification of Diseases. Policy guidance had been provided by a number of special meetings and by the Expert Committee on the International Classification of Diseases - Tenth Revision, which met in 1984 (2) and 1987 (3) to make decisions on the direction the work should take and the form of the final proposals.Extensive preparatory activity had been devoted to a radical review of the suitability of the structure of the ICD, essentially a statistical classification of diseases and other health problems, to serve a wide variety of needs for mortality and health-care data. Ways of stabilizing the coding system to minimize disruption at successive revisions had been investigated, as had the possibility of providing a better balance between the content of the different chapters of the ICD.14
Vol1_B&W.indb   14 15/09/15   12:09",17
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE
Even with a new structure, it was plain that one classification could not cope with the extremes of the requirements. The concept of a ‘family’ of classifications had therefore been developed, with the main ICD as the core, covering the centre ground of needs for traditional mortality and morbidity statistics, while needs for more detailed, less detailed or different classifications and associated matters would be dealt with by other members of the family.Several alternative models for the structure of the ICD had been investigated by the collaborating centres, but it had been found that each had unsatisfactory features and none had sufficient advantages over the existing structure to justify replacing it. Special meetings held to evaluate the ninth revision had confirmed that, although some potential users found the existing structure of the ICD unsuitable, there was a large body of satisfied users who considered it had many inherent strengths, whatever its apparent inconsistencies, and wished it to continue in its existing form.Various schemes involving alphanumeric notation had been examined, with a view to producing a coding frame that would give a better balance to the chapters and allow sufficient space for future additions and changes without disrupting the codes.Decisions made on these matters had paved the way for the preparation of successive drafts of chapter proposals for the 10th revision. These had twice been circulated to Member States for comment, as well as being reviewed by other interested bodies, meetings of centre heads, and the expert committee. A large number of international professional specialist associations, individual specialists and experts, other WHO headquarters units and regional offices had given advice and guidance to the WHO unit responsible for the ICD, and to the collaborating centres, on the preparation of the proposals and the associated material placed before the conference. WHO gratefully acknowledged this assistance.
3. General characteristics and content of the 
proposed 10th revision of the ICD
The main innovation in the proposals for the 10th revision was the use of an alphanumeric coding scheme of one letter followed by three numbers at the four-character level. This had the effect of more than doubling the size of the coding frame in comparison with the ninth revision and enabled the vast majority of chapters to be assigned a unique letter or group of letters, each capable of providing 100 three-character categories. Of the 26 available letters, 25 had been used, the letter U being left vacant for future additions and changes and for possible interim classifications to solve difficulties arising at the national and international level between revisions.15
Vol1_B&W.indb   15 15/09/15   12:09",18
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESAs a matter of policy, some three-character categories had been left vacant for future expansion and revision, with the number varying according to the chapters: those with a primarily anatomical axis of classification had fewer vacant categories, as it was considered that future changes in their content would be more limited in nature.The ninth revision contained 17 chapters plus two supplementary classifications: the Supplementary Classification of External Causes of Injury and Poisoning (the E code) and the Supplementary Classification of Factors Influencing Health Status and Contact with Health Services (the V code). As recommended by the Preparatory Meeting on the Tenth Revision (Geneva, 1983) (4) and endorsed by subsequent meetings, these two chapters were no longer considered to be supplementary but were included as a part of the core classification.The order of entry of chapters in the proposals for the 10th revision had originally been the same as in the ninth revision; however, to make effective use of the available space, disorders of the immune mechanism were later included with diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs, whereas in the ninth revision they had been included with endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases. The new chapter on ‘Diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism’ now followed the ‘Neoplasms’ chapter, with which it shared the letter D.During the elaboration of early drafts of the chapter on ‘Diseases of the nervous system and sense organs’, it had soon become clear that it would not be possible to accommodate all the required detail under one letter in 100 three-character categories. It had been decided, therefore, to create three separate chapters - ‘Diseases of the nervous system’ having the letter G, and the two chapters on ‘Diseases of the eye and adnexa’ and on ‘Diseases of the ear and mastoid process’ sharing the letter H.Also, the chapters on ‘Diseases of the genitourinary system’, on ‘Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium’, on ‘Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period’, and on ‘Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities’ had been brought together as contiguous chapters XIV to XVII.With the inclusion of the former supplementary classifications as part of the core classification and the creation of two new chapters, the total number of chapters in the proposal for the 10th revision had become 21. The titles of some chapters had been amended to give a better indication of their content.Where radical changes to the ICD had been proposed, field-testing had been appropriate. This had been the case for the following chapters:16
Vol1_B&W.indb   16 15/09/15   12:09",19
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCEV . Mental and behavioural disorders XIX. Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes XX. External causes of morbidity and mortalityChapter II, ‘Neoplasms’, had also been subject to some field-testing, although the changes in its content had been of a minor nature.Some new features of the proposals for the 10th revision were as follows:
• The exclusion notes at the beginning of each chapter had been expanded 
to explain the relative hierarchy of chapters, and to make it clear that the ‘special group’ chapters had priority of assignment over the organ or system chapters and that, among the special group chapters, those on ‘Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium‘ and on ‘Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period’ had priority over the others.
• Also, at the beginning of each chapter an overview was given of the blocks 
of three-character categories and, where relevant, the asterisk categories; this had been done to clarify the structure of the chapters and to facilitate the use of the asterisk categories.
• The notes in the tabular list applied to all uses of the classification; if a note 
was appropriate only to morbidity or only to mortality, it was included in the special notes accompanying either the morbidity coding rules or the mortality coding rules.
• The ninth revision had identified a certain number of conditions as being 
drug-induced; this approach had been continued in drawing up the proposals for the 10th revision, and many such conditions were now separately identified.An important innovation was the creation, towards the end of certain chapters, of categories for postprocedural disorders. These identified important conditions that constituted a medical care problem in their own right and included such examples as endocrine and metabolic diseases following ablation of an organ and other specific conditions such as postgastrectomy dumping syndrome. Postprocedural conditions that were not specific to a particular body system, including immediate complications such as air embolism and postoperative shock, continued to be classified in the chapter on ‘Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes’.Another change was that in the ninth revision, the four-digit titles had often had to be read in conjunction with the three-digit titles, to ascertain the full meaning and intent of the subcategory, whereas in the draft presented to the conference the titles were almost invariably complete and could stand alone.The dual classification scheme for etiology and manifestation, known as the dagger and asterisk system, introduced in the ninth revision, had been the 17
Vol1_B&W.indb   17 15/09/15   12:09",20
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESsubject of a certain amount of criticism. This related mainly to the fact that the classification frequently contained a mixture of manifestation and other information at the three- and four-digit levels, with the same diagnostic labels sometimes appearing under both axes. Also, many considered the system to be insufficiently comprehensive. To overcome these problems, in the draft for the 10th revision, the asterisk information was contained in 82 homogeneous three-character categories for optional use. This approach enabled those diagnostic statements containing information about both a generalized underlying disease process and a manifestation or complication in a particular organ or site to receive two codes, allowing retrieval or tabulation according to either axis.These characteristics of the proposed 10th revision were accepted by the conference.Each of the chapters was introduced to the conference, with a presentation on changes introduced since the ninth revision and some background information about certain innovations. Some issues related to changes in chapter structure and content were discussed by the conference and agreement reached on follow-up and modification by the secretariat.
4. Standards and definitions related to maternal 
and child health
The conference considered with interest the recommended definitions, standards and reporting requirements for the 10th  revision with regard to maternal mortality and to fetal, perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality. These recommendations were the outcome of a series of special meetings and consultations and were directed towards improving the comparability of data.The conference agreed that it was desirable to retain the definitions of live birth and fetal death as they appeared in the ninth revision.After some discussion, the conference set up a working party on the subject of maternal mortality and, on the basis of its recommendations, also agreed to retain the definition of maternal death as it appeared in the ninth revision.In order to improve the quality of maternal mortality data and provide alternative methods of collecting data on deaths during pregnancy or related to it, as well as to encourage the recording of deaths from obstetric causes occurring more than 42 days following termination of pregnancy, two additional definitions, for ‘pregnancy-related deaths’ and ‘late maternal deaths’, were formulated by the working party. [These are included in the section Definitions, p.1069].18

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCEThe conferenceRECOMMENDED that countries consider the inclusion on death certificates of questions regarding current pregnancy and pregnancy within one year preceding death.The conference agreed that, since the number of live births was more universally available than the number of total births (live births plus fetal deaths), it should be used as the denominator in the ratios related to maternal mortality [as contained in V olume 2].With respect to perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality, it was strongly advised that published rates based on birth cohorts should be so identified and differentiated.The conference confirmed the practice of expressing age in completed units of time and thus designating the first day of life as day zero.The conferenceRECOMMENDED the inclusion, in the manual of the 10th revision of the ICD, of definitions, standards and reporting requirements related to maternal mortality and to fetal, perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality .
5. Coding and selection rules and tabulation lists
5.1. Coding and selection rules for mortality
The conference was informed about a process for review of the selection and modification rules for underlying cause of death and the associated notes, as they appeared in the ninth revision, which had resulted in several recommended changes in the rules and extensive changes to the notes.The conferenceRECOMMENDED that the rules for selection of cause of death for primary mortality tabulation, as they appear in the ninth revision, be replaced in the 10th revision [by those contained in V olume 2].The conference was further informed that additional notes for use in underlying cause coding and the interpretation of entries of causes of death had been drafted and were being reviewed. As these notes were intended to improve consistency in coding, the conference agreed that they would also be incorporated in the 10th revision.The conference noted the continued use of multiple-condition coding and analysis in relation to causes of death. It expressed encouragement for such activities, but did not recommend that the 10th revision should contain any particular rules or methods of analysis to be followed.19
Vol1_B&W.indb   19 15/09/15   12:09",22
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESIn considering the international form of medical certificate of cause of death, the expert committee had recognized that the situation of an aging population with a greater proportion of deaths involving multiple disease processes, and the effects of associated therapeutic interventions, tended to increase the number of possible statements between the underlying cause and the direct cause of death: this meant that an increasing number of conditions were being entered on death certificates in many countries. This led the committee to recommend the inclusion of an additional line (d) in Part I of the certificate.The conference thereforeRECOMMENDED that, where a need has been identified, countries consider the possibility of including an additional line (d) in Part I of the medical certificate of cause of death.
5.2. Coding and selection rules for morbidity
For the first time, the ninth revision contained guidance on recording and coding for morbidity and specifically for the selection of a single condition for presentation of morbidity statistics. Experience gained in the use of the definitions and rules in the ninth revision had proved their usefulness and generated requests for their clarification, for further elaboration regarding the recording of diagnostic information by health-care practitioners, and for more guidance on dealing with specific problem situations.The conference endorsed the recommendations of the 1975 Revision Conference about the condition to be selected for single-condition analysis of episodes of health care, and its view that, where practicable, multiple-condition coding and analysis should be undertaken to supplement routine statistics. It stressed that the 10th revision should make it clear that much of the guidance was applicable only when the tabulation of a ‘main condition’ for an episode was appropriate and when the concept of an ‘episode’ per se was relevant to the way in which data collection was organized.The conference accordinglyRECOMMENDED that additional guidance on the recording and coding of morbidity should be included in the 10th  Revision, and that the definitions of “main condition” and “other conditions” should be incorporated, together with the modified rules for dealing with obviously incorrectly reported “main condition”. [These are included in V olume 2.]The conference alsoRECOMMENDED that where the “main condition” is subject to the dual classification system provided in the ICD, both the dagger and asterisk codes should be recorded, to permit alternative tabulation by either.20

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCEThe conference agreed that extensive notes and examples should be added to provide further assistance.
5.3. Lists for tabulation of mortality and morbidity
The conference was informed about difficulties that had arisen in the use of the Basic tabulation list based on the ninth revision and about the activities that had been undertaken, particularly by WHO, to develop new lists for the tabulation and publication of mortality data. In this process it had become apparent that, in 
many countries, mortality up to the age of 5  years was a more robust indicator 
than infant mortality, and that it would therefore be preferable to have a list that 
included infant deaths and deaths of children up to the age of 5  years, rather than 
a list for infants only.Two versions of the general mortality list and of the infant and child mortality list had been prepared for consideration by the conference, with the second version including chapter titles and residual items for chapters as necessary.As some concerns were expressed regarding the mortality lists as presented, a small working party was convened to consider the possible inclusion of some additional items. The report of the working party was accepted by the Conference and is reflected in the mortality lists (see Special tabulation list for mortality and morbidity, p. 1043).On the topic of lists for the tabulation of morbidity, the conference reviewed both a proposed tabulation list and a model publication list based on chapter titles, with selected items included as examples under each title. Considerable concern was expressed about the applicability of such lists to all morbidity in the broadest sense. There was general agreement that the lists as presented were probably more suited to inpatient morbidity, and it was felt that further efforts should be made to develop lists suitable for other morbidity applications, and also that both mortality and morbidity tabulation lists should be accompanied in the 10th revision by appropriate explanations and instructions on their use.In light of the concerns raised in the conference and the conclusions of the working party, the conference agreed that the tabulation and publication lists should appear in the 10th revision, while an effort should be made to establish clearer, more descriptive titles for these lists. It was also agreed that, to facilitate the alternative tabulation of asterisk categories, a second version of the morbidity tabulation list should be developed, which included the asterisk categories.

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES6. Family of classifications
6.1. Concept of the family of classifications
During the preparation of the ninth revision it had already been realized that the ICD alone could not cover all the information required and that only a ‘family’ of disease and health-related classifications would meet the different requirements in public health. Since the late 1970s, therefore, various possible solutions had been envisaged, one of which called for a core classification (ICD) with a series of modules, some hierarchically related and others of a supplementary nature.After studies and discussions in cooperation with the various collaborating centres, a concept of a family of classifications had been elaborated and subsequently revised by the expert committee in 1987, which had recommended the scheme shown below.

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCEThe conferenceRECOMMENDED that the concept of the family of disease and health-related classifications should be followed up by WHO.In order to maintain the integrity of the ICD itself and this family concept, the conferenceRECOMMENDED that, in the interests of international comparability, no changes should be made to the content (as indicated by the titles) of the three-character categories and four-character sub-categories of the 10th revision in the preparation of translations or adaptations, except as authorized by WHO. The Secretariat of WHO is responsible for the ICD and acts as central clearing-house for any publication (except national statistical publications) or translation to be derived from it. WHO should be promptly notified about the intention to produce translations and adaptations or other ICD-related classifications.The conference viewed with interest a presentation of the use and linkage of different members of the ICD family in the medicosocial and multidimensional assessment of the elderly in relation not only to health but also to activities of daily living as well as the social and physical environment. It was demonstrated that effective information could be obtained through use of the ICD and the International classification of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps  (ICIDH), and especially through use of the codes from the proposed Chapter XXI of the 10th revision.
6.2. Specialty-based adaptations
The conference was informed about plans for the development of adaptations of the 10th revision in the mental health programme area. Clinical guidelines would accompany a version intended for use by clinicians working in the field of psychiatry; research criteria would be proposed for use in investigations of mental health problems; and multi-axial presentations for use in dealing with childhood disorders and for the classification of adult problems would be developed, as well as a version for use by general practitioners. Compilations of ICD codes relevant to psychiatry and to neurology would also be produced, along the lines of previous publications on this subject.The Conference also heard about the methods used to ensure that the basic structure and function of the ICD were preserved in the initial development of the application for medical specialists in dentistry and stomatology (ICD-DA) and was informed that a new revision of the ICD-DA linked to the 10th revision was in the final stages of preparation.A presentation was given on the International classification of diseases for oncology (ICD-O), second edition, a multi-axial classification including both 23

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESthe topography and morphology of neoplasms. The morphology codes of the ICD-O, which had evolved over a long period of time, had been revised and extensively field-tested. The topography codes of the second edition would be based on categories C00–C80 in the 10th revision and publication would, therefore, await World Health Assembly approval of the 10th revision.There was agreement on the value of an adaptation in the area of general medical practice and the conference was informed about the willingness of groups working in this area to collaborate with WHO. In respect of other specialty-based adaptations, which were likely to become more numerous, the recommended role of WHO as a clearing-house was considered to be extremely important.
6.3. Information support to primary health care
In accordance with the recommendations of the 1975 Revision Conference, a working group had been convened by the WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia in Delhi in 1976. It had drawn up a detailed list of symptom associations and, from this, two short lists were derived, one for causes of death and one for reasons for contact with health services. Field trials of this system had been carried out in countries of the region and the results used to revise the list of symptom associations and the reporting forms. This revised version had been published by WHO in 1978, in the booklet Lay reporting of health information (6).The Global strategy for health for all by the year 2000 (7) , launched in 1978, had raised a number of challenges for the development of information systems in Member States. At the International Conference on Health Statistics for the Year 2000 (Bellagio, Italy, 1982) (8), the integration of ‘lay reporting’ information with other information generated and used for health management purposes had been identified as a major problem inhibiting the wider implementation of lay reporting schemes. The Consultation on primary care classifications (Geneva, 1985) (9) had stressed the need for an approach that could unify information support, health service management and community services through information based on lay reporting in the expanded sense of community-based information.The conference was informed about the experience of countries in developing and applying community-based health information that covered health problems and needs, related risk factors and resources. It supported the concept of developing non-conventional methods at the community level as a method of filling information gaps in individual countries and strengthening their information systems. It was stressed that, for both developed and developing countries, such methods or systems should be developed locally and that, because of factors such as morbidity patterns, as well as language and cultural variations, transfer to other areas or countries should not be attempted.24

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE6.4. Impairments, disabilities and handicaps
The International classification of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps  (ICIDH) (5) had been published by WHO in English in 1980 for trial purposes, in accordance with the recommendations of the 1975 revision conference and resolution WHA29.35 (10) of the 1976 World Health Assembly. Since that time, research and development on the classification had followed a number of paths.The major definitions of the three elements – impairment, disability and handicap – had undoubtedly been instrumental in changing attitudes to disablement. The definition of ‘impairment’, an area where there was considerable overlap with the terms included in the ICD, had been widely accepted. The definition of ‘disability’ broadly matched the field of action of rehabilitation professionals and groups, although there was felt to be a need for more attention in the associated code to the gradation of severity, which was often a predictor of handicap. There had also been increasing requests to revise the definition of ‘handicap’ in order to put more emphasis on the effect of interaction with the environment.The rapid evolution of ideas and practices in the management of disablement had ruled out the production of a revised ICIDH in time to be submitted to the conference. It was stated that the publication of a new version was unlikely before implementation of the 10th revision.
6.5. Procedures in medicine
The International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM) (11) had been published by WHO in 1978 for trial purposes, in accordance with the recommendations of the 1975 Revision Conference and resolution WHA29.35 (10) of the 1976 World Health Assembly. The classification had been adopted by a few countries and was used as a basis for national classifications of surgical operations by a number of other countries.The heads of WHO collaborating centres for classification of diseases had recognized that the process of drafting proposals, obtaining comments, redrafting and soliciting further comments, which WHO necessarily had to go through before finalization and publication, was inappropriate in such a rapidly advancing field as that of procedures. The centre heads had therefore recommended that there should be no revision of the ICPM in conjunction with the 10th revision of ICD.In 1987 the expert committee had asked that WHO consider updating for the 10th revision at least the outline of Chapter 5, ‘Surgical procedures’, of the trial ICPM. In response to this request and the needs expressed by a number of countries, an attempt had been made by the Secretariat to prepare a tabulation list for procedures.25
Vol1_B&W.indb   25 15/09/15   12:09",28
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESThis list had been presented to the centre heads at their 1989 meeting and it had been agreed that it could serve as a guide for national presentation or publication of statistics on surgical procedures and could also facilitate intercountry comparisons. The aim of the list was to identify procedures and groups of procedures and define them as a basis for the development of national classifications, thereby improving the comparability of such classifications.The conference agreed that such a list was of value and that work should continue on its development, even though any publication would follow the implementation of the 10th revision.
6.6. International Nomenclature of Diseases
Since 1970, the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) had been involved in the preparation of an International Nomenclature of Diseases (IND), which would serve as a complement to the ICD.The main purpose of the IND was to provide a single recommended name for every morbid entity. The main criteria for selection of that name were that it should be specific, unambiguous, as self-descriptive and simple as possible, and based on cause wherever feasible. Each disease or syndrome for which a name was recommended was defined as unambiguously and as briefly as possible. A list of synonyms was appended to each definition.At the time of the conference, volumes had been published on diseases of the lower respiratory tract, infectious diseases (viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases and mycoses) and cardiac and vascular diseases, and work was under way on volumes for the digestive system, female genital system, urinary and male genital system, metabolic and endocrine diseases, blood and blood-forming organs, immunological system, musculoskeletal system and nervous system. Subjects proposed for future volumes included psychiatric diseases, as well as diseases of the skin, ear, nose and throat, and eye and adnexa.The conference recognized that an authoritative, up-to-date and international nomenclature of diseases was important in developing the ICD and improving the comparability of health information. The conference thereforeRECOMMENDED that WHO and CIOMS be encouraged to explore cost-efficient ways to achieve the timely completion and maintenance of such a nomenclature.
7. Implementation of the 10th revision of the ICD
The conference was informed of WHO’s intention to publish the detailed four-character version of the 10th revision in three volumes: one containing the tabular list, a second containing all related definitions, standards, rules and instructions, and a third containing the alphabetical index.26
Vol1_B&W.indb   26 15/09/15   12:09",29
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCEThe conference was further informed that a three-character version of the 10th revision would be published as a single volume which would contain, in the tabular list, all inclusion and exclusion notes. It would also contain all related definitions, standards, rules and instructions and a shortened alphabetical index.Member States intending to produce national language versions of the 10th revision should notify WHO of their intentions. Copies of the drafts of the ICD at the three- and four-character levels would be made available from WHO both in printed form and on electronic media.With respect to the physical appearance of the pages and type formats for both the tabular list and the alphabetical index, the conference was assured that recommendations from the centre heads and complaints from coders would be considered, and every attempt made to improve those aspects as compared with the ninth revision.As with the ninth revision, it was intended to develop materials for the reorientation of trained coders, with the help of the collaborating centres. The actual training courses would be the responsibility of the WHO regional offices and individual countries. They would be carried out from late 1991 to the end of 1992, to finish before the implementation of the 10th revision.Materials for the basic training of new users of the ICD would also be developed by WHO; it was not, however, planned to begin courses before 1993.As noted above, WHO would be prepared to provide the 10th revision (both the tabular list and the alphabetical index) on electronic media. In future, with the assistance of the collaborating centres, other software might also be made available. A key for conversion from the ninth to the 10th revision, and the reverse, should be available before the implementation of the 10th  revision.As the development activities that had been endorsed by the expert committee were on schedule, the conferenceRECOMMENDED that the 10th revision of the International classification of diseases should come into effect as from 1 January 1993.
8. Future revision of the ICD
The conference discussed the difficulties experienced during the extended period of use of the ninth revision, related to the emergence of new diseases and the lack of an updating mechanism to accommodate them.Various suggestions for mechanisms to overcome these difficulties and avoid similar problems with respect to the 10th revision were discussed. There was a clear feeling that there was a need for ongoing information exchange to standardize the use of the 10th revision between countries, but that any changes introduced during its ‘lifetime’ should be considered very carefully in relation 27
Vol1_B&W.indb   27 15/09/15   12:09",30
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESto their impact on analyses and trends. There was discussion on the type of forum in which such changes and the potential for use of the vacant letter ‘U’ in new or temporary code assignments could be discussed. It was agreed that it would not be feasible to hold revision conferences more frequently than every 10 years.On the basis of the needs expressed, and the fact that it would be inappropriate to attempt to determine or define the exact process to be used, the conferenceRECOMMENDED that the next International revision conference should take place in ten years’ time, and that WHO should endorse the concept of an updating process between revisions and give consideration as to how an effective updating mechanism could be put in place.
9. Adoption of the 10th Revision of the ICD
The conference made the following recommendation:Having considered the proposals prepared by the organization on the basis of the recommendations of the expert committee on the International classification of diseases – 10th  revision,Recognizing the need for a few further minor modifications to reflect the comments on points of detail submitted by Member States during the conference,RECOMMENDED that the proposed revised chapters, with their three-character categories and four-character subcategories and the Short tabulation lists for morbidity and mortality, constitute the 10th revision of the International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems.

Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected by dengue viruses. It is one disease entity with different clinical presentations and often with unpredictable clinical evolution and outcome. Most patients recover following a self-limiting non-severe clinical course like nausea, vomiting, rash, aches and pains, but a small proportion progress to severe disease, mostly characterized by plasma leakage with or without haemorrhage, although severe haemorrhages or severe organ impairment can occur, with or without dengue shock.

Notes
1.	Primary, 	ill-defined, 	secondary 	and	unspecified 	sites	of	
malignant 	neoplasms
Categories 	C76−C80	include	malignant 	neoplasms 	for	which	there	is	no	clear	indication	of	the	
original site of the cancer, or the cancer is stated to be ‘disseminated’, ‘scattered’ or ‘spread’ without mention of the primary site. In both cases the primary site is considered to be unknown.
2.	Functional 	activity
All	neoplasms 	are	classified	in	this	chapter,	whether	they	are	functionally 	active	or	
not. An additional code from Chapter IV may be used, if desired, to identify functional activity associated with any neoplasm. For example, catecholamine-producing malignant phaeochromocytoma of adrenal gland should be coded to C74 with additional code E27.5; basophil adenoma of pituitary gland with Cushing syndrome should be coded to D35.2 with additional code E24.0.CHAPTER II

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES3.	Morphology
There are a number of major morphological (histological) groups of malignant neoplasms: carcinomas including squamous (cell) and adenocarcinomas; sarcomas; other soft tissue tumours including mesotheliomas; lymphomas (Hodgkin and non-
Hodgkin); 	leukaemia; 	other	specified	and	site-specific 	types;	and	unspecified 	cancers.	
Cancer is a generic term and may be used for any of the above groups, although it is rarely applied to the malignant neoplasms of lymphatic, haematopoietic and related tissue. ‘Carcinoma’ is sometimes used incorrectly as a synonym for ‘cancer’. 
In	Chapter	II,	neoplasms 	are	classified	predominantly 	by	site	within	broad	groupings 	
for behaviour. In a few exceptional cases, morphology is indicated in the category and subcategory titles.For those wishing to identify the histological type of neoplasm, the list of morphology codes of ICD-O is available for separate download online.  The list formerly included in ICD-10 was outdated because it was derived from the second edition of the International classification of diseases for oncology
	(ICD-O).	ICD-O	is	a	dual-axis	classification 	
providing independent coding systems for topography and morphology. Morphology 
codes	have	six	digits:	the	first	four	digits	identify	the	histological 	type;	the	fifth	digit	
is the behaviour code (malignant primary, malignant secondary (metastatic), in situ, benign, uncertain whether malignant or benign); and the sixth digit is a grading code (differentiation) for solid tumours, and is also used as a special code for lymphomas and leukaemias.The ICD-O lists can be downloaded from the classification website of WHO (www.who.int/classifications).
4.	Use	of	subcategories 	in	Chapter	II
Attention is drawn to the special use of subcategory .8 in this chapter [see note 5]. Where it has been necessary to provide subcategories for ‘other’, these have generally been designated as subcategory .7.
5.	Malignant 	neoplasms 	overlapping 	site	boundaries 	and	the	
use	of	subcategory 	.8	(overlapping 	lesion)
Categories 	C00−C75 	classify	primary	malignant 	neoplasms 	according 	to	their	point	
of origin. Many three-character categories are further divided into named parts or subcategories of the organ in question. A neoplasm that overlaps two or more contiguous sites within a three-character category, and whose point of origin cannot be determined, 
should	be	classified	to	the	subcategory 	.8	(‘overlapping 	lesion’),	unless	the	combination 	
is	specifically 	indexed	elsewhere. 	For	example,	carcinoma 	of	oesophagus 	and	stomach	
is	specifically 	indexed	to	C16.0	(cardia),	while	carcinoma 	of	the	tip	and	ventral	surface	
of the tongue should be assigned to C02.8. On the other hand, carcinoma of the tip of the tongue extending to involve the ventral surface should be coded to C02.1, as the point of origin, the tip, is known. ‘Overlapping’ implies that the sites involved are contiguous (next to each other). Numerically consecutive subcategories are frequently anatomically contiguous, but this is not invariably so (e.g. bladder C67.-) and the coder may need to consult anatomical texts to determine the topographical relationships.

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"167
CHAPTER II NEOPLASMSSometimes a neoplasm overlaps the boundaries of three-character categories within certain systems. To take care of this, the following subcategories have been designated:
C02.8  Overlapping lesion of tongue
C08.8  Overlapping lesion of major salivary glands
C14.8  Overlapping lesion of lip, oral cavity and pharynx
C21.8  Overlapping lesion of rectum, anus and anal canal
C24.8  Overlapping lesion of biliary tract
C26.8  Overlapping lesion of digestive system
C39.8  Overlapping lesion of respiratory and intrathoracic organs
C41.8  Overlapping lesion of bone and articular cartilage
C49.8  Overlapping lesion of connective and soft tissue
C57.8  Overlapping lesion of female genital organs
C63.8  Overlapping lesion of male genital organs
C68.8  Overlapping lesion of urinary organs
C72.8  Overlapping lesion of central nervous system
An example of this is a carcinoma of the stomach and small intestine, which should be coded to C26.8 (Overlapping lesion of digestive system).
6.	Malignant 	neoplasms 	of	ectopic	tissue
Malignant neoplasms of ectopic tissue are to be coded to the site where they are found, e.g. ectopic pancreatic malignant neoplasms of ovary are coded to ovary (C56).
7.	Use	of	the	Alphabetical 	index	in	coding	neoplasms
In addition to site, morphology and behaviour must also be taken into consideration 
when	coding	neoplasms, 	and	reference	should	always	be	made	first	to	the	Alphabetical 	
index entry for the morphological description.The introductory pages of V olume 3 include general instructions about the correct use of 
the	Alphabetical 	index.	The	specific	instructions 	and	examples	pertaining 	to	neoplasms 	
should be consulted to ensure correct use of the categories and subcategories in Chapter II.
8.	Use	of	the	International classification of diseases for oncology
	(ICD-O)
For certain morphological types, Chapter II provides a rather restricted topographical 
classification, 	or	none	at	all.	The	topography 	codes	of	ICD-O	use	for	all	neoplasms 	
essentially the same three- and four-character categories that Chapter II uses for 
malignant 	neoplasms 	(C00−C77, 	C80),	thus	providing 	increased 	specificity 	of	site	for	
other neoplasms (malignant secondary (metastatic), benign, in situ and uncertain or unknown).It is therefore recommended that agencies interested in identifying both the site and morphology of tumours, e.g. cancer registries, cancer hospitals, pathology departments and other agencies specializing in cancer, use ICD-O.

In	situ	neoplasms  (D00–D09)
Note:  Many in situ neoplasms are regarded as being located within a continuum of 
morphological change between dysplasia and invasive cancer. For example, for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), three grades are recognized, the third of which (CIN III) includes both severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. This system of grading has been extended to other organs, such as vulva and vagina. Descriptions of grade III intraepithelial neoplasia, with or without mention of severe dysplasia, are assigned to this section; grades 
I	and	II	are	classified	as	dysplasia	of	the	organ	system	involved	and	should	
be coded to the relevant body system chapter.Incl.:

When	one	or	more	previous	measurements 	are	available, 	lack	of	weight	
gain	in	children,	or	evidence	of	weight	loss	in	children	or	adults,	is	usually	
indicative 	of	malnutrition. 	When	only	one	measurement 	is	available, 	the

or laboratory tests. In the exceptional circumstances that no measurement of 
weight	is	available, 	reliance	should	be	placed	on	clinical	evidence.
If	an	observed	weight	is	below	the	mean	value	of	the	reference	population,

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESOrganic, including symptomatic, mental disorders (F00–F09)
This	block	comprises 	a	range	of	mental	disorders	grouped	together	on	the	basis	of	their	
having	in	common	a	demonstrable 	etiology	in	cerebral	disease,	brain	injury,	or	other	
insult	leading	to	cerebral	dysfunction. 	The	dysfunction 	may	be	primary,	as	in	diseases,	
injuries,	and	insults	that	affect	the	brain	directly	and	selectively; 	or	secondary, 	as	in	
systemic	diseases	and	disorders	that	attack	the	brain	only	as	one	of	the	multiple	organs	
or	systems	of	the	body	that	are	involved.
Dementia 	(F00–F03) 	is	a	syndrome 	due	to	disease	of	the	brain,	usually	of	a	chronic	or	
progressive 	nature,	in	which	there	is	disturbance 	of	multiple	higher	cortical	functions, 	
including 	memory,	thinking,	orientation, 	comprehension, 	calculation, 	learning	capacity,	
language	and	judgement. 	Consciousness 	is	not	clouded.	The	impairments 	of	cognitive	
function	are	commonly 	accompanied, 	and	occasionally 	preceded, 	by	deterioration 	in	
emotional 	control,	social	behaviour 	or	motivation. 	This	syndrome 	occurs	in	Alzheimer 	
disease,	in	cerebrovascular 	disease,	and	in	other	conditions 	primarily	or	secondarily 	
affecting	the	brain.
Use	additional 	code,	if	desired,	to	identify	the	underlying 	disease.

disturbances 	in	level	of	consciousness, 	cognition, 	perception, 	affect	or	behaviour, 	or	
other	psycho-physiological 	functions	and	responses. 	The	disturbances 	are	directly	
related	to	the	acute	pharmacological 	effects	of	the	substance 	and	resolve	with	time,	
with	complete	recovery,	except	where	tissue	damage	or	other	complications 	have	
arisen.	Complications 	may	include	trauma,	inhalation 	of	vomitus,	delirium,	coma,	
convulsions, 	and	other	medical	complications. 	The	nature	of	these	complications 	
depends	on	the	pharmacological 	class	of	substance 	and	mode	of	administration.

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES.1  Harmful use
A	pattern	of	psychoactive 	substance 	use	that	is	causing	damage	to	health.	The	
damage	may	be	physical	(as	in	cases	of	hepatitis	from	the	self-administration 	of	
injected	psychoactive 	substances) 	or	mental	(e.g.	episodes	of	depressive 	disorder	
secondary 	to	heavy	consumption 	of	alcohol).
Psychoactive 	substance 	abuse
.2  Dependence syndrome
A	cluster	of	behavioural, 	cognitive	and	physiological 	phenomena 	that	develop	after	
repeated	substance 	use	and	that	typically	include	a	strong	desire	to	take	the	drug,	
difficulties 	in	controlling 	its	use,	persisting 	in	its	use	despite	harmful	consequences, 	
a	higher	priority	given	to	drug	use	than	to	other	activities	and	obligations, 	increased 	
tolerance, 	and	sometimes 	a	physical	withdrawal 	state.
The	dependence 	syndrome 	may	be	present	for	a	specific	psychoactive 	substance 	
(e.g.	tobacco,	alcohol	or	diazepam), 	for	a	class	of	substances 	(e.g.	opioid	drugs)	or	
for	a	wider	range	of	pharmacologically 	different	psychoactive 	substances.
Chronic	alcoholism
Dipsomania
Drug	addiction
.3  Withdrawal state
A	group	of	symptoms 	of	variable	clustering 	and	severity,	occurring	on	absolute	or	
relative	withdrawal 	of	a	psychoactive 	substance 	after	persistent	use	of	that	substance. 	
The	onset	and	course	of	the	withdrawal 	state	are	time-limited 	and	are	related	to	the	
type	of	psychoactive 	substance 	and	dose	being	used	immediately 	before	cessation	or	
reduction	of	use.	The	withdrawal 	state	may	be	complicated 	by	convulsions.
.4  Withdrawal state with delirium
A	condition 	where	the	withdrawal 	state	as	defined	in	the	common	fourth	character	
.3	is	complicated 	by	delirium	as	defined	in	F05.-.	Convulsions 	may	also	occur.	
When organic factors are also considered to play a role in the etiology, the condition 
should	be	classified	to	F05.8.
Delirium	tremens	(alcohol-induced)
.5  Psychotic disorder
A	cluster	of	psychotic 	phenomena 	that	occur	during	or	following 	psychoactive 	
substance 	use	but	that	are	not	explained 	on	the	basis	of	acute	intoxication 	alone	
and	do	not	form	part	of	a	withdrawal 	state.	The	disorder	is	characterized 	by	
hallucinations 	(typically 	auditory,	but	often	in	more	than	one	sensory	modality), 	
perceptual 	distortions, 	delusions 	(often	of	a	paranoid	or	persecutory 	nature),	
psychomotor 	disturbances 	(excitement 	or	stupor)	and	an	abnormal 	affect,	which	
may	range	from	intense	fear	to	ecstasy.	The	sensorium 	is	usually	clear	but	some	
degree	of	clouding	of	consciousness, 	though	not	severe	confusion, 	may	be	present.

A	syndrome 	associated 	with	chronic	prominent 	impairment 	of	recent	and	
remote	memory.	Immediate 	recall	is	usually	preserved 	and	recent	memory	is	
characteristically 	more	disturbed	than	remote	memory.	Disturbances 	of	time

a	direct	psychoactive-substance-related 	effect	might	reasonably 	be	assumed	to

episode(s) 	of	such	substance 	use	should	be	coded	here	only	where	clear	and	strong	
evidence	is	available	to	attribute	the	state	to	the	residual	effect	of	the	psychoactive 	
substance. 	Flashbacks 	may	be	distinguished 	from	psychotic 	state	partly	by	their

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"CHAPTER V MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL DISORDERS293Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (F20–F29)
This	block	brings	together	schizophrenia, 	as	the	most	important 	member	of	the	group,	
schizotypal 	disorder,	persistent 	delusional 	disorders, 	and	a	larger	group	of	acute	and	
transient	psychotic 	disorders. 	Schizoaffective 	disorders	have	been	retained	here	in	spite	
of	their	controversial 	nature.
  F20   Schizophrenia
The	schizophrenic 	disorders	are	characterized 	in	general	by	fundamental 	
and characteristic distortions of thinking and perception, and affects that are 
inappropriate 	or	blunted.	Clear	consciousness 	and	intellectual 	capacity	are	usually	
maintained, 	although	certain	cognitive	deficits	may	evolve	in	the	course	of	time.	
The	most	important 	psychopathological 	phenomena 	include	thought	echo;	thought	
insertion	or	withdrawal; 	thought	broadcasting; 	delusional 	perception 	and	delusions 	
of	control;	influence	or	passivity; 	hallucinatory 	voices	commenting 	or	discussing 	
the	patient	in	the	third	person;	thought	disorders; 	and	negative	symptoms.
The	course	of	schizophrenic 	disorders	can	be	either	continuous, 	or	episodic	with	
progressive 	or	stable	deficit,	or	there	can	be	one	or	more	episodes	with	complete	
or	incomplete 	remission. 	The	diagnosis 	of	schizophrenia 	should	not	be	made	
in	the	presence	of	extensive 	depressive 	or	manic	symptoms 	unless	it	is	clear	
that	schizophrenic 	symptoms 	antedate	the	affective	disturbance. 	Nor	should	
schizophrenia 	be	diagnosed 	in	the	presence	of	overt	brain	disease	or	during	states	
of	drug	intoxication 	or	withdrawal. 	Similar	disorders	developing 	in	the	presence	of	
epilepsy	or	other	brain	disease	should	be	classified	under	F06.2,	and	those	induced	
by	psychoactive 	substances 	under	F10–F19	with	common	fourth	character	.5.

• acute	(undifferentiated) 	(F23.2)	
• cyclic	(F25.2)	
schizophrenic 	reaction	(F23.2)	
schizotypal 	disorder	(F21)	
F20.0  Paranoid schizophrenia
Paranoid	schizophrenia 	is	dominated 	by	relatively 	stable,	often	paranoid	delusions, 	
usually	accompanied 	by	hallucinations, 	particularly 	of	the	auditory	variety,	and	
perceptual 	disturbances. 	Disturbances 	of	affect,	volition	and	speech,	and	catatonic	
symptoms, 	are	either	absent	or	relatively 	inconspicuous.
Paraphrenic 	schizophrenia
Excl.:	 involutional 	paranoid	state	(F22.8)

F20.1  Hebephrenic schizophrenia
A	form	of	schizophrenia 	in	which	affective	changes	are	prominent, 	delusions 	and	
hallucinations 	fleeting	and	fragmentary, 	behaviour 	irresponsible 	and	unpredictable, 	
and	mannerisms 	common.	The	mood	is	shallow	and	inappropriate, 	thought	is	
disorganized, 	and	speech	is	incoherent. 	There	is	a	tendency	to	social	isolation.	
Usually	the	prognosis 	is	poor	because	of	the	rapid	development 	of	‘negative’ 	
symptoms, 	particularly 	flattening 	of	affect	and	loss	of	volition.	Hebephrenia 	should	
normally	be	diagnosed 	only	in	adolescents 	or	young	adults.

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESF20.2  Catatonic schizophrenia
Catatonic 	schizophrenia 	is	dominated 	by	prominent 	psychomotor 	disturbances 	
that	may	alternate	between	extremes	such	as	hyperkinesis 	and	stupor,	or	automatic 	
obedience 	and	negativism. 	Constrained 	attitudes	and	postures	may	be	maintained 	
for	long	periods.	Episodes	of	violent	excitement 	may	be	a	striking	feature	of	the	
condition. 	The	catatonic	phenomena 	may	be	combined 	with	a	dream-like 	(oneiroid) 	
state	with	vivid	scenic	hallucinations.

• catalepsy
• catatonia

F20.3  Undifferentiated schizophrenia
Psychotic 	conditions 	meeting	the	general	diagnostic 	criteria	for	schizophrenia 	but	
not	conforming 	to	any	of	the	subtypes	in	F20.0–F20.2, 	or	exhibiting 	the	features

F20.4  Post-schizophrenic depression
A	depressive 	episode,	which	may	be	prolonged, 	arising	in	the	aftermath 	of	
a	schizophrenic 	illness.	Some	schizophrenic 	symptoms, 	either	‘positive’ 	or	
‘negative’, 	must	still	be	present	but	they	no	longer	dominate	the	clinical	picture.	
These	depressive 	states	are	associated 	with	an	increased 	risk	of	suicide.	If	the	
patient	no	longer	has	any	schizophrenic 	symptoms, 	a	depressive 	episode	should	
be	diagnosed 	(F32.-).	If	schizophrenic 	symptoms 	are	still	florid	and	prominent, 	
the	diagnosis 	should	remain	that	of	the	appropriate 	schizophrenic 	subtype	(F20.0–
F20.3).
F20.5  Residual schizophrenia
A	chronic	stage	in	the	development 	of	a	schizophrenic 	illness	in	which	there	has	
been	a	clear	progression 	from	an	early	stage	to	a	later	stage	characterized 	by	long-	
term,	though	not	necessarily 	irreversible, 	‘negative’ 	symptoms, 	e.g.	psychomotor 	
slowing;	underactivity; 	blunting	of	affect;	passivity	and	lack	of	initiative; 	poverty	of	
quantity	or	content	of	speech;	poor	nonverbal 	communication 	by	facial	expression, 	
eye	contact,	voice	modulation 	and	posture;	poor	self-care	and	social	performance.

conduct,	inability	to	meet	the	demands	of	society,	and	decline	in	total	performance. 	The	
characteristic 	negative	features	of	residual	schizophrenia 	(e.g.	blunting	of	affect	and	
loss	of	volition)	develop	without	being	preceded	by	any	overt	psychotic	symptoms.

A	disorder	characterized 	by	the	development 	either	of	a	single	delusion	or	of	a	
set	of	related	delusions 	that	are	usually	persistent 	and	sometimes 	lifelong.	The	
content	of	the	delusion	or	delusions 	is	very	variable.	Clear	and	persistent 	auditory	
hallucinations 	(voices),	schizophrenic 	symptoms 	such	as	delusions 	of	control	and	
marked	blunting	of	affect,	and	definite	evidence	of	brain	disease	are	all	incompatible 	
with	this	diagnosis. 	However, 	the	presence	of	occasional 	or	transitory 	auditory	
hallucinations, 	particularly 	in	elderly	patients,	does	not	rule	out	this	diagnosis, 	
provided	that	they	are	not	typically	schizophrenic 	and	form	only	a	small	part	of	the

F22.9  Persistent delusional disorder, unspecified
  F23   Acute and transient psychotic disorders
A	heterogeneous 	group	of	disorders	characterized 	by	the	acute	onset	of	psychotic 	
symptoms 	such	as	delusions, 	hallucinations 	and	perceptual 	disturbances, 	and	by	
the	severe	disruption 	of	ordinary	behaviour. 	Acute	onset	is	defined	as	a	crescendo 	
development 	of	a	clearly	abnormal 	clinical	picture	in	about	two	weeks	or	less.	
For	these	disorders, 	there	is	no	evidence	of	organic	causation. 	Perplexity 	and	
puzzlement 	are	often	present	but	disorientation 	for	time,	place	and	person	is	not	
persistent 	or	severe	enough	to	justify	a	diagnosis 	of	organically 	caused	delirium	
(F05.-).	Complete 	recovery	usually	occurs	within	a	few	months,	often	within	a	
few	weeks	or	even	days.	If	the	disorder	persists,	a	change	in	classification 	will	be	
necessary. 	The	disorder	may	or	may	not	be	associated 	with	acute	stress,	defined	as	
usually	stressful	events	preceding 	the	onset	by	one	to	two	weeks.

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"Introduction
A classification of diseases may be defined as a system of categories to which morbid entities are assigned according to established criteria. There are many possible axes of classification and the one selected will depend upon the use to be made of the statistics to be compiled. A statistical classification of diseases must encompass the entire range of morbid conditions within a manageable number of categories.The 10th revision of the International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems is the latest in a series that was formalized in 1893 as the Bertillon classification or International list of causes of death. A complete review of the historical background to the classification is given in V olume 2. While the title has been amended to make clearer the content and purpose and to reflect the progressive extension of the scope of the classification beyond diseases and injuries, the familiar abbreviation ‘ICD’ has been retained. In the updated classification, conditions have been grouped in a way that was felt to be most suitable for general epidemiological purposes and the evaluation of health care.Work on the 10th revision of the ICD started in September 1983 when a Preparatory Meeting on ICD-10 was convened in Geneva. The programme of work was guided by regular meetings of heads of WHO collaborating centres for classification of diseases. Policy guidance was provided by a number of special meetings, including those of the expert committee on the International classification of diseases – 10th revision, held in 1984 and 1987.In addition to the technical contributions provided by many specialist groups and individual experts, a large number of comments and suggestions were received from WHO Member States and regional offices as a result of the global circulation of draft proposals for revision in 1984 and 1986. From the comments received, it was clear that many users wished the ICD to encompass types of data other than the ‘diagnostic information’ (in the broadest sense of the term) that it has always covered. In order to accommodate the perceived needs of these users, the concept arose of a ‘family’ of classifications centred on the traditional ICD with its familiar form and structure. The ICD itself would thus meet the requirement for diagnostic information for general purposes, while a variety of other classifications would be used in conjunction with it and would deal either with different approaches to the same information or with different information (notably medical and surgical procedures and disablement).Following suggestions at the time of development of the ninth revision of the classification that a different basic structure might better serve the needs of the many and varied users, several alternative models were evaluated. It became clear, however, that the traditional single-variable-axis design of 1

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESthe classification, and other aspects of its structure that gave emphasis to conditions that were frequent, costly or otherwise of public health importance, had withstood the test of time and that many users would be unhappy with any of the models that had been proposed as a possible replacement.Consequently, as study of the 10th revision will show, the traditional ICD structure has been retained but an alphanumeric coding scheme replaces the previous numeric one. This provides a larger coding frame and leaves room for future revision without disruption of the numbering system, as has occurred at previous revisions.In order to make optimum use of the available space, certain disorders of the immune mechanism are included with diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs (Chapter III). New chapters have been created for diseases of the eye and adnexa, and diseases of the ear and mastoid process. The former supplementary classifications of external causes and of factors influencing health status and contact with health services now form part of the main classification.The dagger and asterisk system of dual classification for certain diagnostic statements, introduced in the ninth revision, has been retained and extended, with the asterisk axis being contained in homogeneous categories at the three-character level.
Content of the three volumes of ICD-10
The presentation of the classification has been changed and there are now three volumes:Volume 1. Tabular list. This contains the Report of the International Conference for the Tenth Revision, the classification itself at the three- and four-character levels, the classification of the morphology of neoplasms, special tabulation lists for mortality and morbidity, definitions, and the nomenclature regulations.Volume 2. Instruction manual. This brings together the notes on certification and classification formerly included in V olume 1, with a good deal of new background and instructional matter and guidance on the use of V olume 1, on tabulations, and on planning for the use of the ICD, which was seen as lacking in earlier revisions. It also includes the historical material formerly presented in the introduction to V olume 1.Volume 3. Alphabetical index. This presents the index itself with an introduction and expanded instructions on its use.* * *The classification was approved by the International Conference for the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases in 1989 and adopted by 2

The periodic revision of the ICD has, since the sixth revision in 1948, been coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO). As the use of the classification has increased, so, understandably, has the desire among its users to contribute to the revision process. The 10th revision is the product of a vast amount of international activity, cooperation and compromise, and WHO acknowledges with gratitude the contributions of the international and national specialist groups and individuals in numerous many countries.WHO gratefully acknowledges the important technical contribution of the WHO Collaborating Centre for the Family of International Classifications which is located at the Deutsches Institut für Medizinische Dokumentation und Information (DIMDI) in Cologne, Germany, and, in particular, that of the Head of the Centre Michael Schopen, in the updating of the texts and the preparation of the electronic files that were used for this version of ICD-10.

Thirteen WHO Collaborating Centres for the Family of International Classifications have been established to assist countries with problems encountered in the development and use of health-related classifications and, in particular, in the use of the ICD.It is important that countries bring to the attention of the respective centre any significant problems they might encounter in the use of the ICD, and especially when a new disease for which the ICD does not provide a suitable classification is encountered frequently. Until now, the ICD has not been updated between revisions but for ICD-10, through the centres, a mechanism has been introduced to provide suitable codes for new diseases where necessary.In addition to the official WHO collaborating centres, there are a number of national reference centres and individual users should first consult these, or their appropriate national office, when they encounter problems.There are three centres for English-language users.

Dr Jardel spoke of the extensive consultations and preparatory work that had gone into the revision proposals and had necessitated a longer than usual interval between revisions. He noted that the 10th revision would have a new title, International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems, to emphasize its statistical purpose and reflect the widening of its scope. The convenient abbreviation ICD would, however, be retained. He also mentioned the new alphanumeric coding scheme, which had made it possible to provide a better balance between the content of the chapters and to leave room for future additions and changes, as well as the intention to produce an ICD manual of three-character categories with an alphabetical index for use where the more complex, detailed four-character version would be inappropriate.The Conference elected the following officers:Dr RHC Wells, Australia (Chairman)  Dr H Bay-Nielsen, Denmark (Vice-Chairman)  Dr R Braun, German Democratic Republic (Vice-Chairman)  Mr RA Israel, United States of America (Vice-Chairman)  Dr  R Laurenti, Brazil (Vice-Chairman) Dr P Maguin, France (Rapporteur)  Ms E Taylor, Canada (Rapporteur).The secretariat of the conference was as follows:Dr JP Jardel, Assistant Director-General, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland  Dr HR Hapsara, Director, Division of Epidemiological Surveillance and Health Situation and Trend Assessment, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland  Dr JC Alary, Chief Medical Officer, Development of Epidemiological and Health Statistical Services, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland  Dr GR Brämer, Medical Officer, Development of Epidemiological and Health Statistical Services, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland (Secretary)  Mr A L’Hours, Technical Officer, Development of Epidemiological and Health Statistical Services, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland Professor W Jänisch, German Democratic Republic (Temporary Adviser)  Mr T Kruse, Denmark (Temporary Adviser)  Dr K Kupka, France (Temporary Adviser)  Dr J Leowski, Poland (Temporary Adviser)  REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE

1. History and development of uses of the 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
The conference was reminded of the impressive history of a statistical classification that dated back to the eighteenth century. While early revisions of the classification had been concerned only with causes of death, its scope had been extended at the sixth revision in 1948 to include non-fatal diseases. This extension had continued through the ninth revision, with certain innovations being made to meet the statistical needs of widely differing organizations. In addition, at the International Conference for the ninth revision (Geneva, 1975) (1), recommendations had been made and approved for the publication, for trial purposes, of supplementary classifications of procedures in medicine and of impairments, disabilities and handicaps.
2. Review of activities in the preparation of 
proposals for the Tenth Revision of the ICD
The proposals before the conference were the product of a vast amount of activity at WHO headquarters and around the world. The programme of work had been guided by regular meetings of the heads of WHO Collaborating Centres for Classification of Diseases. Policy guidance had been provided by a number of special meetings and by the Expert Committee on the International Classification of Diseases - Tenth Revision, which met in 1984 (2) and 1987 (3) to make decisions on the direction the work should take and the form of the final proposals.Extensive preparatory activity had been devoted to a radical review of the suitability of the structure of the ICD, essentially a statistical classification of diseases and other health problems, to serve a wide variety of needs for mortality and health-care data. Ways of stabilizing the coding system to minimize disruption at successive revisions had been investigated, as had the possibility of providing a better balance between the content of the different chapters of the ICD.14
Vol1_B&W.indb   14 15/09/15   12:09",17
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE
Even with a new structure, it was plain that one classification could not cope with the extremes of the requirements. The concept of a ‘family’ of classifications had therefore been developed, with the main ICD as the core, covering the centre ground of needs for traditional mortality and morbidity statistics, while needs for more detailed, less detailed or different classifications and associated matters would be dealt with by other members of the family.Several alternative models for the structure of the ICD had been investigated by the collaborating centres, but it had been found that each had unsatisfactory features and none had sufficient advantages over the existing structure to justify replacing it. Special meetings held to evaluate the ninth revision had confirmed that, although some potential users found the existing structure of the ICD unsuitable, there was a large body of satisfied users who considered it had many inherent strengths, whatever its apparent inconsistencies, and wished it to continue in its existing form.Various schemes involving alphanumeric notation had been examined, with a view to producing a coding frame that would give a better balance to the chapters and allow sufficient space for future additions and changes without disrupting the codes.Decisions made on these matters had paved the way for the preparation of successive drafts of chapter proposals for the 10th revision. These had twice been circulated to Member States for comment, as well as being reviewed by other interested bodies, meetings of centre heads, and the expert committee. A large number of international professional specialist associations, individual specialists and experts, other WHO headquarters units and regional offices had given advice and guidance to the WHO unit responsible for the ICD, and to the collaborating centres, on the preparation of the proposals and the associated material placed before the conference. WHO gratefully acknowledged this assistance.
3. General characteristics and content of the 
proposed 10th revision of the ICD
The main innovation in the proposals for the 10th revision was the use of an alphanumeric coding scheme of one letter followed by three numbers at the four-character level. This had the effect of more than doubling the size of the coding frame in comparison with the ninth revision and enabled the vast majority of chapters to be assigned a unique letter or group of letters, each capable of providing 100 three-character categories. Of the 26 available letters, 25 had been used, the letter U being left vacant for future additions and changes and for possible interim classifications to solve difficulties arising at the national and international level between revisions.15
Vol1_B&W.indb   15 15/09/15   12:09",18
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESAs a matter of policy, some three-character categories had been left vacant for future expansion and revision, with the number varying according to the chapters: those with a primarily anatomical axis of classification had fewer vacant categories, as it was considered that future changes in their content would be more limited in nature.The ninth revision contained 17 chapters plus two supplementary classifications: the Supplementary Classification of External Causes of Injury and Poisoning (the E code) and the Supplementary Classification of Factors Influencing Health Status and Contact with Health Services (the V code). As recommended by the Preparatory Meeting on the Tenth Revision (Geneva, 1983) (4) and endorsed by subsequent meetings, these two chapters were no longer considered to be supplementary but were included as a part of the core classification.The order of entry of chapters in the proposals for the 10th revision had originally been the same as in the ninth revision; however, to make effective use of the available space, disorders of the immune mechanism were later included with diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs, whereas in the ninth revision they had been included with endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases. The new chapter on ‘Diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism’ now followed the ‘Neoplasms’ chapter, with which it shared the letter D.During the elaboration of early drafts of the chapter on ‘Diseases of the nervous system and sense organs’, it had soon become clear that it would not be possible to accommodate all the required detail under one letter in 100 three-character categories. It had been decided, therefore, to create three separate chapters - ‘Diseases of the nervous system’ having the letter G, and the two chapters on ‘Diseases of the eye and adnexa’ and on ‘Diseases of the ear and mastoid process’ sharing the letter H.Also, the chapters on ‘Diseases of the genitourinary system’, on ‘Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium’, on ‘Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period’, and on ‘Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities’ had been brought together as contiguous chapters XIV to XVII.With the inclusion of the former supplementary classifications as part of the core classification and the creation of two new chapters, the total number of chapters in the proposal for the 10th revision had become 21. The titles of some chapters had been amended to give a better indication of their content.Where radical changes to the ICD had been proposed, field-testing had been appropriate. This had been the case for the following chapters:16
Vol1_B&W.indb   16 15/09/15   12:09",19
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCEV . Mental and behavioural disorders XIX. Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes XX. External causes of morbidity and mortalityChapter II, ‘Neoplasms’, had also been subject to some field-testing, although the changes in its content had been of a minor nature.Some new features of the proposals for the 10th revision were as follows:
• The exclusion notes at the beginning of each chapter had been expanded 
to explain the relative hierarchy of chapters, and to make it clear that the ‘special group’ chapters had priority of assignment over the organ or system chapters and that, among the special group chapters, those on ‘Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium‘ and on ‘Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period’ had priority over the others.
• Also, at the beginning of each chapter an overview was given of the blocks 
of three-character categories and, where relevant, the asterisk categories; this had been done to clarify the structure of the chapters and to facilitate the use of the asterisk categories.
• The notes in the tabular list applied to all uses of the classification; if a note 
was appropriate only to morbidity or only to mortality, it was included in the special notes accompanying either the morbidity coding rules or the mortality coding rules.
• The ninth revision had identified a certain number of conditions as being 
drug-induced; this approach had been continued in drawing up the proposals for the 10th revision, and many such conditions were now separately identified.An important innovation was the creation, towards the end of certain chapters, of categories for postprocedural disorders. These identified important conditions that constituted a medical care problem in their own right and included such examples as endocrine and metabolic diseases following ablation of an organ and other specific conditions such as postgastrectomy dumping syndrome. Postprocedural conditions that were not specific to a particular body system, including immediate complications such as air embolism and postoperative shock, continued to be classified in the chapter on ‘Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes’.Another change was that in the ninth revision, the four-digit titles had often had to be read in conjunction with the three-digit titles, to ascertain the full meaning and intent of the subcategory, whereas in the draft presented to the conference the titles were almost invariably complete and could stand alone.The dual classification scheme for etiology and manifestation, known as the dagger and asterisk system, introduced in the ninth revision, had been the 17
Vol1_B&W.indb   17 15/09/15   12:09",20
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESsubject of a certain amount of criticism. This related mainly to the fact that the classification frequently contained a mixture of manifestation and other information at the three- and four-digit levels, with the same diagnostic labels sometimes appearing under both axes. Also, many considered the system to be insufficiently comprehensive. To overcome these problems, in the draft for the 10th revision, the asterisk information was contained in 82 homogeneous three-character categories for optional use. This approach enabled those diagnostic statements containing information about both a generalized underlying disease process and a manifestation or complication in a particular organ or site to receive two codes, allowing retrieval or tabulation according to either axis.These characteristics of the proposed 10th revision were accepted by the conference.Each of the chapters was introduced to the conference, with a presentation on changes introduced since the ninth revision and some background information about certain innovations. Some issues related to changes in chapter structure and content were discussed by the conference and agreement reached on follow-up and modification by the secretariat.
4. Standards and definitions related to maternal 
and child health
The conference considered with interest the recommended definitions, standards and reporting requirements for the 10th  revision with regard to maternal mortality and to fetal, perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality. These recommendations were the outcome of a series of special meetings and consultations and were directed towards improving the comparability of data.The conference agreed that it was desirable to retain the definitions of live birth and fetal death as they appeared in the ninth revision.After some discussion, the conference set up a working party on the subject of maternal mortality and, on the basis of its recommendations, also agreed to retain the definition of maternal death as it appeared in the ninth revision.In order to improve the quality of maternal mortality data and provide alternative methods of collecting data on deaths during pregnancy or related to it, as well as to encourage the recording of deaths from obstetric causes occurring more than 42 days following termination of pregnancy, two additional definitions, for ‘pregnancy-related deaths’ and ‘late maternal deaths’, were formulated by the working party. [These are included in the section Definitions, p.1069].18
Vol1_B&W.indb   18 15/09/15   12:09",21
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCEThe conferenceRECOMMENDED that countries consider the inclusion on death certificates of questions regarding current pregnancy and pregnancy within one year preceding death.The conference agreed that, since the number of live births was more universally available than the number of total births (live births plus fetal deaths), it should be used as the denominator in the ratios related to maternal mortality [as contained in V olume 2].With respect to perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality, it was strongly advised that published rates based on birth cohorts should be so identified and differentiated.The conference confirmed the practice of expressing age in completed units of time and thus designating the first day of life as day zero.The conferenceRECOMMENDED the inclusion, in the manual of the 10th revision of the ICD, of definitions, standards and reporting requirements related to maternal mortality and to fetal, perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality .
5. Coding and selection rules and tabulation lists
5.1. Coding and selection rules for mortality
The conference was informed about a process for review of the selection and modification rules for underlying cause of death and the associated notes, as they appeared in the ninth revision, which had resulted in several recommended changes in the rules and extensive changes to the notes.The conferenceRECOMMENDED that the rules for selection of cause of death for primary mortality tabulation, as they appear in the ninth revision, be replaced in the 10th revision [by those contained in V olume 2].The conference was further informed that additional notes for use in underlying cause coding and the interpretation of entries of causes of death had been drafted and were being reviewed. As these notes were intended to improve consistency in coding, the conference agreed that they would also be incorporated in the 10th revision.The conference noted the continued use of multiple-condition coding and analysis in relation to causes of death. It expressed encouragement for such activities, but did not recommend that the 10th revision should contain any particular rules or methods of analysis to be followed.19
Vol1_B&W.indb   19 15/09/15   12:09",22
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESIn considering the international form of medical certificate of cause of death, the expert committee had recognized that the situation of an aging population with a greater proportion of deaths involving multiple disease processes, and the effects of associated therapeutic interventions, tended to increase the number of possible statements between the underlying cause and the direct cause of death: this meant that an increasing number of conditions were being entered on death certificates in many countries. This led the committee to recommend the inclusion of an additional line (d) in Part I of the certificate.The conference thereforeRECOMMENDED that, where a need has been identified, countries consider the possibility of including an additional line (d) in Part I of the medical certificate of cause of death.
5.2. Coding and selection rules for morbidity
For the first time, the ninth revision contained guidance on recording and coding for morbidity and specifically for the selection of a single condition for presentation of morbidity statistics. Experience gained in the use of the definitions and rules in the ninth revision had proved their usefulness and generated requests for their clarification, for further elaboration regarding the recording of diagnostic information by health-care practitioners, and for more guidance on dealing with specific problem situations.The conference endorsed the recommendations of the 1975 Revision Conference about the condition to be selected for single-condition analysis of episodes of health care, and its view that, where practicable, multiple-condition coding and analysis should be undertaken to supplement routine statistics. It stressed that the 10th revision should make it clear that much of the guidance was applicable only when the tabulation of a ‘main condition’ for an episode was appropriate and when the concept of an ‘episode’ per se was relevant to the way in which data collection was organized.The conference accordinglyRECOMMENDED that additional guidance on the recording and coding of morbidity should be included in the 10th  Revision, and that the definitions of “main condition” and “other conditions” should be incorporated, together with the modified rules for dealing with obviously incorrectly reported “main condition”. [These are included in V olume 2.]The conference alsoRECOMMENDED that where the “main condition” is subject to the dual classification system provided in the ICD, both the dagger and asterisk codes should be recorded, to permit alternative tabulation by either.20

5.3. Lists for tabulation of mortality and morbidity
The conference was informed about difficulties that had arisen in the use of the Basic tabulation list based on the ninth revision and about the activities that had been undertaken, particularly by WHO, to develop new lists for the tabulation and publication of mortality data. In this process it had become apparent that, in 
many countries, mortality up to the age of 5  years was a more robust indicator 
than infant mortality, and that it would therefore be preferable to have a list that 
included infant deaths and deaths of children up to the age of 5  years, rather than 
a list for infants only.Two versions of the general mortality list and of the infant and child mortality list had been prepared for consideration by the conference, with the second version including chapter titles and residual items for chapters as necessary.As some concerns were expressed regarding the mortality lists as presented, a small working party was convened to consider the possible inclusion of some additional items. The report of the working party was accepted by the Conference and is reflected in the mortality lists (see Special tabulation list for mortality and morbidity, p. 1043).On the topic of lists for the tabulation of morbidity, the conference reviewed both a proposed tabulation list and a model publication list based on chapter titles, with selected items included as examples under each title. Considerable concern was expressed about the applicability of such lists to all morbidity in the broadest sense. There was general agreement that the lists as presented were probably more suited to inpatient morbidity, and it was felt that further efforts should be made to develop lists suitable for other morbidity applications, and also that both mortality and morbidity tabulation lists should be accompanied in the 10th revision by appropriate explanations and instructions on their use.In light of the concerns raised in the conference and the conclusions of the working party, the conference agreed that the tabulation and publication lists should appear in the 10th revision, while an effort should be made to establish clearer, more descriptive titles for these lists. It was also agreed that, to facilitate the alternative tabulation of asterisk categories, a second version of the morbidity tabulation list should be developed, which included the asterisk categories.

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES6. Family of classifications
6.1. Concept of the family of classifications
During the preparation of the ninth revision it had already been realized that the ICD alone could not cover all the information required and that only a ‘family’ of disease and health-related classifications would meet the different requirements in public health. Since the late 1970s, therefore, various possible solutions had been envisaged, one of which called for a core classification (ICD) with a series of modules, some hierarchically related and others of a supplementary nature.After studies and discussions in cooperation with the various collaborating centres, a concept of a family of classifications had been elaborated and subsequently revised by the expert committee in 1987, which had recommended the scheme shown below.

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCEThe conferenceRECOMMENDED that the concept of the family of disease and health-related classifications should be followed up by WHO.In order to maintain the integrity of the ICD itself and this family concept, the conferenceRECOMMENDED that, in the interests of international comparability, no changes should be made to the content (as indicated by the titles) of the three-character categories and four-character sub-categories of the 10th revision in the preparation of translations or adaptations, except as authorized by WHO. The Secretariat of WHO is responsible for the ICD and acts as central clearing-house for any publication (except national statistical publications) or translation to be derived from it. WHO should be promptly notified about the intention to produce translations and adaptations or other ICD-related classifications.The conference viewed with interest a presentation of the use and linkage of different members of the ICD family in the medicosocial and multidimensional assessment of the elderly in relation not only to health but also to activities of daily living as well as the social and physical environment. It was demonstrated that effective information could be obtained through use of the ICD and the International classification of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps  (ICIDH), and especially through use of the codes from the proposed Chapter XXI of the 10th revision.
6.2. Specialty-based adaptations
The conference was informed about plans for the development of adaptations of the 10th revision in the mental health programme area. Clinical guidelines would accompany a version intended for use by clinicians working in the field of psychiatry; research criteria would be proposed for use in investigations of mental health problems; and multi-axial presentations for use in dealing with childhood disorders and for the classification of adult problems would be developed, as well as a version for use by general practitioners. Compilations of ICD codes relevant to psychiatry and to neurology would also be produced, along the lines of previous publications on this subject.The Conference also heard about the methods used to ensure that the basic structure and function of the ICD were preserved in the initial development of the application for medical specialists in dentistry and stomatology (ICD-DA) and was informed that a new revision of the ICD-DA linked to the 10th revision was in the final stages of preparation.A presentation was given on the International classification of diseases for oncology (ICD-O), second edition, a multi-axial classification including both 23

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESthe topography and morphology of neoplasms. The morphology codes of the ICD-O, which had evolved over a long period of time, had been revised and extensively field-tested. The topography codes of the second edition would be based on categories C00–C80 in the 10th revision and publication would, therefore, await World Health Assembly approval of the 10th revision.There was agreement on the value of an adaptation in the area of general medical practice and the conference was informed about the willingness of groups working in this area to collaborate with WHO. In respect of other specialty-based adaptations, which were likely to become more numerous, the recommended role of WHO as a clearing-house was considered to be extremely important.
6.3. Information support to primary health care
In accordance with the recommendations of the 1975 Revision Conference, a working group had been convened by the WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia in Delhi in 1976. It had drawn up a detailed list of symptom associations and, from this, two short lists were derived, one for causes of death and one for reasons for contact with health services. Field trials of this system had been carried out in countries of the region and the results used to revise the list of symptom associations and the reporting forms. This revised version had been published by WHO in 1978, in the booklet Lay reporting of health information (6).The Global strategy for health for all by the year 2000 (7) , launched in 1978, had raised a number of challenges for the development of information systems in Member States. At the International Conference on Health Statistics for the Year 2000 (Bellagio, Italy, 1982) (8), the integration of ‘lay reporting’ information with other information generated and used for health management purposes had been identified as a major problem inhibiting the wider implementation of lay reporting schemes. The Consultation on primary care classifications (Geneva, 1985) (9) had stressed the need for an approach that could unify information support, health service management and community services through information based on lay reporting in the expanded sense of community-based information.The conference was informed about the experience of countries in developing and applying community-based health information that covered health problems and needs, related risk factors and resources. It supported the concept of developing non-conventional methods at the community level as a method of filling information gaps in individual countries and strengthening their information systems. It was stressed that, for both developed and developing countries, such methods or systems should be developed locally and that, because of factors such as morbidity patterns, as well as language and cultural variations, transfer to other areas or countries should not be attempted.24

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE6.4. Impairments, disabilities and handicaps
The International classification of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps  (ICIDH) (5) had been published by WHO in English in 1980 for trial purposes, in accordance with the recommendations of the 1975 revision conference and resolution WHA29.35 (10) of the 1976 World Health Assembly. Since that time, research and development on the classification had followed a number of paths.The major definitions of the three elements – impairment, disability and handicap – had undoubtedly been instrumental in changing attitudes to disablement. The definition of ‘impairment’, an area where there was considerable overlap with the terms included in the ICD, had been widely accepted. The definition of ‘disability’ broadly matched the field of action of rehabilitation professionals and groups, although there was felt to be a need for more attention in the associated code to the gradation of severity, which was often a predictor of handicap. There had also been increasing requests to revise the definition of ‘handicap’ in order to put more emphasis on the effect of interaction with the environment.The rapid evolution of ideas and practices in the management of disablement had ruled out the production of a revised ICIDH in time to be submitted to the conference. It was stated that the publication of a new version was unlikely before implementation of the 10th revision.
6.5. Procedures in medicine
The International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM) (11) had been published by WHO in 1978 for trial purposes, in accordance with the recommendations of the 1975 Revision Conference and resolution WHA29.35 (10) of the 1976 World Health Assembly. The classification had been adopted by a few countries and was used as a basis for national classifications of surgical operations by a number of other countries.The heads of WHO collaborating centres for classification of diseases had recognized that the process of drafting proposals, obtaining comments, redrafting and soliciting further comments, which WHO necessarily had to go through before finalization and publication, was inappropriate in such a rapidly advancing field as that of procedures. The centre heads had therefore recommended that there should be no revision of the ICPM in conjunction with the 10th revision of ICD.In 1987 the expert committee had asked that WHO consider updating for the 10th revision at least the outline of Chapter 5, ‘Surgical procedures’, of the trial ICPM. In response to this request and the needs expressed by a number of countries, an attempt had been made by the Secretariat to prepare a tabulation list for procedures.25
Vol1_B&W.indb   25 15/09/15   12:09",28
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESThis list had been presented to the centre heads at their 1989 meeting and it had been agreed that it could serve as a guide for national presentation or publication of statistics on surgical procedures and could also facilitate intercountry comparisons. The aim of the list was to identify procedures and groups of procedures and define them as a basis for the development of national classifications, thereby improving the comparability of such classifications.The conference agreed that such a list was of value and that work should continue on its development, even though any publication would follow the implementation of the 10th revision.
6.6. International Nomenclature of Diseases
Since 1970, the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) had been involved in the preparation of an International Nomenclature of Diseases (IND), which would serve as a complement to the ICD.The main purpose of the IND was to provide a single recommended name for every morbid entity. The main criteria for selection of that name were that it should be specific, unambiguous, as self-descriptive and simple as possible, and based on cause wherever feasible. Each disease or syndrome for which a name was recommended was defined as unambiguously and as briefly as possible. A list of synonyms was appended to each definition.At the time of the conference, volumes had been published on diseases of the lower respiratory tract, infectious diseases (viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases and mycoses) and cardiac and vascular diseases, and work was under way on volumes for the digestive system, female genital system, urinary and male genital system, metabolic and endocrine diseases, blood and blood-forming organs, immunological system, musculoskeletal system and nervous system. Subjects proposed for future volumes included psychiatric diseases, as well as diseases of the skin, ear, nose and throat, and eye and adnexa.The conference recognized that an authoritative, up-to-date and international nomenclature of diseases was important in developing the ICD and improving the comparability of health information. The conference thereforeRECOMMENDED that WHO and CIOMS be encouraged to explore cost-efficient ways to achieve the timely completion and maintenance of such a nomenclature.
7. Implementation of the 10th revision of the ICD
The conference was informed of WHO’s intention to publish the detailed four-character version of the 10th revision in three volumes: one containing the tabular list, a second containing all related definitions, standards, rules and instructions, and a third containing the alphabetical index.26
Vol1_B&W.indb   26 15/09/15   12:09",29
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCEThe conference was further informed that a three-character version of the 10th revision would be published as a single volume which would contain, in the tabular list, all inclusion and exclusion notes. It would also contain all related definitions, standards, rules and instructions and a shortened alphabetical index.Member States intending to produce national language versions of the 10th revision should notify WHO of their intentions. Copies of the drafts of the ICD at the three- and four-character levels would be made available from WHO both in printed form and on electronic media.With respect to the physical appearance of the pages and type formats for both the tabular list and the alphabetical index, the conference was assured that recommendations from the centre heads and complaints from coders would be considered, and every attempt made to improve those aspects as compared with the ninth revision.As with the ninth revision, it was intended to develop materials for the reorientation of trained coders, with the help of the collaborating centres. The actual training courses would be the responsibility of the WHO regional offices and individual countries. They would be carried out from late 1991 to the end of 1992, to finish before the implementation of the 10th revision.Materials for the basic training of new users of the ICD would also be developed by WHO; it was not, however, planned to begin courses before 1993.As noted above, WHO would be prepared to provide the 10th revision (both the tabular list and the alphabetical index) on electronic media. In future, with the assistance of the collaborating centres, other software might also be made available. A key for conversion from the ninth to the 10th revision, and the reverse, should be available before the implementation of the 10th  revision.As the development activities that had been endorsed by the expert committee were on schedule, the conferenceRECOMMENDED that the 10th revision of the International classification of diseases should come into effect as from 1 January 1993.
8. Future revision of the ICD
The conference discussed the difficulties experienced during the extended period of use of the ninth revision, related to the emergence of new diseases and the lack of an updating mechanism to accommodate them.Various suggestions for mechanisms to overcome these difficulties and avoid similar problems with respect to the 10th revision were discussed. There was a clear feeling that there was a need for ongoing information exchange to standardize the use of the 10th revision between countries, but that any changes introduced during its ‘lifetime’ should be considered very carefully in relation 27
Vol1_B&W.indb   27 15/09/15   12:09",30

There was discussion on the type of forum in which such changes and the potential for use of the vacant letter ‘U’ in new or temporary code assignments could be discussed. It was agreed that it would not be feasible to hold revision conferences more frequently than every 10 years.On the basis of the needs expressed, and the fact that it would be inappropriate to attempt to determine or define the exact process to be used, the conferenceRECOMMENDED that the next International revision conference should take place in ten years’ time, and that WHO should endorse the concept of an updating process between revisions and give consideration as to how an effective updating mechanism could be put in place.
9. Adoption of the 10th Revision of the ICD
The conference made the following recommendation:Having considered the proposals prepared by the organization on the basis of the recommendations of the expert committee on the International classification of diseases – 10th  revision,Recognizing the need for a few further minor modifications to reflect the comments on points of detail submitted by Member States during the conference,RECOMMENDED that the proposed revised chapters, with their three-character categories and four-character subcategories and the Short tabulation lists for morbidity and mortality, constitute the 10th revision of the International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems.

Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected by dengue viruses. It is one disease entity with different clinical presentations and often with unpredictable clinical evolution and outcome. Most patients recover following a self-limiting non-severe clinical course like nausea, vomiting, rash, aches and pains, but a small proportion progress to severe disease, mostly characterized by plasma leakage with or without haemorrhage, although severe haemorrhages or severe organ impairment can occur, with or without dengue shock.

Notes
1.	Primary, 	ill-defined, 	secondary 	and	unspecified 	sites	of	
malignant 	neoplasms
Categories 	C76−C80	include	malignant 	neoplasms 	for	which	there	is	no	clear	indication	of	the	
original site of the cancer, or the cancer is stated to be ‘disseminated’, ‘scattered’ or ‘spread’ without mention of the primary site. In both cases the primary site is considered to be unknown.
2.	Functional 	activity
All	neoplasms 	are	classified	in	this	chapter,	whether	they	are	functionally 	active	or	
not. An additional code from Chapter IV may be used, if desired, to identify functional activity associated with any neoplasm. For example, catecholamine-producing malignant phaeochromocytoma of adrenal gland should be coded to C74 with additional code E27.5; basophil adenoma of pituitary gland with Cushing syndrome should be coded to D35.2 with additional code E24.0.CHAPTER II

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES3.	Morphology
There are a number of major morphological (histological) groups of malignant neoplasms: carcinomas including squamous (cell) and adenocarcinomas; sarcomas; other soft tissue tumours including mesotheliomas; lymphomas (Hodgkin and non-
Hodgkin); 	leukaemia; 	other	specified	and	site-specific 	types;	and	unspecified 	cancers.	
Cancer is a generic term and may be used for any of the above groups, although it is rarely applied to the malignant neoplasms of lymphatic, haematopoietic and related tissue. ‘Carcinoma’ is sometimes used incorrectly as a synonym for ‘cancer’. 
In	Chapter	II,	neoplasms 	are	classified	predominantly 	by	site	within	broad	groupings 	
for behaviour. In a few exceptional cases, morphology is indicated in the category and subcategory titles.For those wishing to identify the histological type of neoplasm, the list of morphology codes of ICD-O is available for separate download online.  The list formerly included in ICD-10 was outdated because it was derived from the second edition of the International classification of diseases for oncology
	(ICD-O).	ICD-O	is	a	dual-axis	classification 	
providing independent coding systems for topography and morphology. Morphology 
codes	have	six	digits:	the	first	four	digits	identify	the	histological 	type;	the	fifth	digit	
is the behaviour code (malignant primary, malignant secondary (metastatic), in situ, benign, uncertain whether malignant or benign); and the sixth digit is a grading code (differentiation) for solid tumours, and is also used as a special code for lymphomas and leukaemias.The ICD-O lists can be downloaded from the classification website of WHO (www.who.int/classifications).
4.	Use	of	subcategories 	in	Chapter	II
Attention is drawn to the special use of subcategory .8 in this chapter [see note 5]. Where it has been necessary to provide subcategories for ‘other’, these have generally been designated as subcategory .7.
5.	Malignant 	neoplasms 	overlapping 	site	boundaries 	and	the	
use	of	subcategory 	.8	(overlapping 	lesion)
Categories 	C00−C75 	classify	primary	malignant 	neoplasms 	according 	to	their	point	
of origin. Many three-character categories are further divided into named parts or subcategories of the organ in question. A neoplasm that overlaps two or more contiguous sites within a three-character category, and whose point of origin cannot be determined, 
should	be	classified	to	the	subcategory 	.8	(‘overlapping 	lesion’),	unless	the	combination 	
is	specifically 	indexed	elsewhere. 	For	example,	carcinoma 	of	oesophagus 	and	stomach	
is	specifically 	indexed	to	C16.0	(cardia),	while	carcinoma 	of	the	tip	and	ventral	surface	
of the tongue should be assigned to C02.8. On the other hand, carcinoma of the tip of the tongue extending to involve the ventral surface should be coded to C02.1, as the point of origin, the tip, is known. ‘Overlapping’ implies that the sites involved are contiguous (next to each other). Numerically consecutive subcategories are frequently anatomically contiguous, but this is not invariably so (e.g. bladder C67.-) and the coder may need to consult anatomical texts to determine the topographical relationships.

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"167
CHAPTER II NEOPLASMSSometimes a neoplasm overlaps the boundaries of three-character categories within certain systems. To take care of this, the following subcategories have been designated:
C02.8  Overlapping lesion of tongue
C08.8  Overlapping lesion of major salivary glands
C14.8  Overlapping lesion of lip, oral cavity and pharynx
C21.8  Overlapping lesion of rectum, anus and anal canal
C24.8  Overlapping lesion of biliary tract
C26.8  Overlapping lesion of digestive system
C39.8  Overlapping lesion of respiratory and intrathoracic organs
C41.8  Overlapping lesion of bone and articular cartilage
C49.8  Overlapping lesion of connective and soft tissue
C57.8  Overlapping lesion of female genital organs
C63.8  Overlapping lesion of male genital organs
C68.8  Overlapping lesion of urinary organs
C72.8  Overlapping lesion of central nervous system
An example of this is a carcinoma of the stomach and small intestine, which should be coded to C26.8 (Overlapping lesion of digestive system).
6.	Malignant 	neoplasms 	of	ectopic	tissue
Malignant neoplasms of ectopic tissue are to be coded to the site where they are found, e.g. ectopic pancreatic malignant neoplasms of ovary are coded to ovary (C56).
7.	Use	of	the	Alphabetical 	index	in	coding	neoplasms
In addition to site, morphology and behaviour must also be taken into consideration 
when	coding	neoplasms, 	and	reference	should	always	be	made	first	to	the	Alphabetical 	
index entry for the morphological description.The introductory pages of V olume 3 include general instructions about the correct use of 
the	Alphabetical 	index.	The	specific	instructions 	and	examples	pertaining 	to	neoplasms 	
should be consulted to ensure correct use of the categories and subcategories in Chapter II.
8.	Use	of	the	International classification of diseases for oncology
	(ICD-O)
For certain morphological types, Chapter II provides a rather restricted topographical 
classification, 	or	none	at	all.	The	topography 	codes	of	ICD-O	use	for	all	neoplasms 	
essentially the same three- and four-character categories that Chapter II uses for 
malignant 	neoplasms 	(C00−C77, 	C80),	thus	providing 	increased 	specificity 	of	site	for	
other neoplasms (malignant secondary (metastatic), benign, in situ and uncertain or unknown).It is therefore recommended that agencies interested in identifying both the site and morphology of tumours, e.g. cancer registries, cancer hospitals, pathology departments and other agencies specializing in cancer, use ICD-O.

In	situ	neoplasms  (D00–D09)
Note:  Many in situ neoplasms are regarded as being located within a continuum of 
morphological change between dysplasia and invasive cancer. For example, for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), three grades are recognized, the third of which (CIN III) includes both severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. This system of grading has been extended to other organs, such as vulva and vagina. Descriptions of grade III intraepithelial neoplasia, with or without mention of severe dysplasia, are assigned to this section; grades 
I	and	II	are	classified	as	dysplasia	of	the	organ	system	involved	and	should	
be coded to the relevant body system chapter.Incl.:

or	systems	of	the	body	that	are	involved.
Dementia 	(F00–F03) 	is	a	syndrome 	due	to	disease	of	the	brain,	usually	of	a	chronic	or	
progressive 	nature,	in	which	there	is	disturbance 	of	multiple	higher	cortical	functions, 	
including 	memory,	thinking,	orientation, 	comprehension, 	calculation, 	learning	capacity,	
language	and	judgement. 	Consciousness 	is	not	clouded.	The	impairments 	of	cognitive	
function	are	commonly 	accompanied, 	and	occasionally 	preceded, 	by	deterioration 	in	
emotional 	control,	social	behaviour 	or	motivation. 	This	syndrome 	occurs	in	Alzheimer 	
disease,	in	cerebrovascular 	disease,	and	in	other	conditions 	primarily	or	secondarily 	
affecting	the	brain.

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES.1  Harmful use
A	pattern	of	psychoactive 	substance 	use	that	is	causing	damage	to	health.	The	
damage	may	be	physical	(as	in	cases	of	hepatitis	from	the	self-administration 	of	
injected	psychoactive 	substances) 	or	mental	(e.g.	episodes	of	depressive 	disorder	
secondary 	to	heavy	consumption 	of	alcohol).
Psychoactive 	substance 	abuse
.2  Dependence syndrome
A	cluster	of	behavioural, 	cognitive	and	physiological 	phenomena 	that	develop	after	
repeated	substance 	use	and	that	typically	include	a	strong	desire	to	take	the	drug,	
difficulties 	in	controlling 	its	use,	persisting 	in	its	use	despite	harmful	consequences, 	
a	higher	priority	given	to	drug	use	than	to	other	activities	and	obligations, 	increased 	
tolerance, 	and	sometimes 	a	physical	withdrawal 	state.
The	dependence 	syndrome 	may	be	present	for	a	specific	psychoactive 	substance 	
(e.g.	tobacco,	alcohol	or	diazepam), 	for	a	class	of	substances 	(e.g.	opioid	drugs)	or	
for	a	wider	range	of	pharmacologically 	different	psychoactive 	substances.
Chronic	alcoholism
Dipsomania
Drug	addiction

A	group	of	symptoms 	of	variable	clustering 	and	severity,	occurring	on	absolute	or	
relative	withdrawal 	of	a	psychoactive 	substance 	after	persistent	use	of	that	substance. 	
The	onset	and	course	of	the	withdrawal 	state	are	time-limited 	and	are	related	to	the	
type	of	psychoactive 	substance 	and	dose	being	used	immediately 	before	cessation	or	
reduction	of	use.	The	withdrawal 	state	may	be	complicated 	by	convulsions.
.4  Withdrawal state with delirium
A	condition 	where	the	withdrawal 	state	as	defined	in	the	common	fourth	character	
.3	is	complicated 	by	delirium	as	defined	in	F05.-.	Convulsions 	may	also	occur.	
When organic factors are also considered to play a role in the etiology, the condition 
should	be	classified	to	F05.8.
Delirium	tremens	(alcohol-induced)

substance 	use	but	that	are	not	explained 	on	the	basis	of	acute	intoxication 	alone	
and	do	not	form	part	of	a	withdrawal 	state.	The	disorder	is	characterized 	by	
hallucinations 	(typically 	auditory,	but	often	in	more	than	one	sensory	modality), 	
perceptual 	distortions, 	delusions 	(often	of	a	paranoid	or	persecutory 	nature),	
psychomotor 	disturbances 	(excitement 	or	stupor)	and	an	abnormal 	affect,	which	
may	range	from	intense	fear	to	ecstasy.	The	sensorium 	is	usually	clear	but	some

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"CHAPTER V MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL DISORDERS293Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (F20–F29)
This	block	brings	together	schizophrenia, 	as	the	most	important 	member	of	the	group,	
schizotypal 	disorder,	persistent 	delusional 	disorders, 	and	a	larger	group	of	acute	and	
transient	psychotic 	disorders. 	Schizoaffective 	disorders	have	been	retained	here	in	spite	
of	their	controversial 	nature.
  F20   Schizophrenia
The	schizophrenic 	disorders	are	characterized 	in	general	by	fundamental 	
and characteristic distortions of thinking and perception, and affects that are 
inappropriate 	or	blunted.	Clear	consciousness 	and	intellectual 	capacity	are	usually	
maintained, 	although	certain	cognitive	deficits	may	evolve	in	the	course	of	time.	
The	most	important 	psychopathological 	phenomena 	include	thought	echo;	thought	
insertion	or	withdrawal; 	thought	broadcasting; 	delusional 	perception 	and	delusions 	
of	control;	influence	or	passivity; 	hallucinatory 	voices	commenting 	or	discussing 	
the	patient	in	the	third	person;	thought	disorders; 	and	negative	symptoms.
The	course	of	schizophrenic 	disorders	can	be	either	continuous, 	or	episodic	with	
progressive 	or	stable	deficit,	or	there	can	be	one	or	more	episodes	with	complete	
or	incomplete 	remission. 	The	diagnosis 	of	schizophrenia 	should	not	be	made	
in	the	presence	of	extensive 	depressive 	or	manic	symptoms 	unless	it	is	clear	
that	schizophrenic 	symptoms 	antedate	the	affective	disturbance. 	Nor	should	
schizophrenia 	be	diagnosed 	in	the	presence	of	overt	brain	disease	or	during	states	
of	drug	intoxication 	or	withdrawal. 	Similar	disorders	developing 	in	the	presence	of	
epilepsy	or	other	brain	disease	should	be	classified	under	F06.2,	and	those	induced	
by	psychoactive 	substances 	under	F10–F19	with	common	fourth	character	.5.

F20.0  Paranoid schizophrenia
Paranoid	schizophrenia 	is	dominated 	by	relatively 	stable,	often	paranoid	delusions, 	
usually	accompanied 	by	hallucinations, 	particularly 	of	the	auditory	variety,	and	
perceptual 	disturbances. 	Disturbances 	of	affect,	volition	and	speech,	and	catatonic	
symptoms, 	are	either	absent	or	relatively 	inconspicuous.

A	form	of	schizophrenia 	in	which	affective	changes	are	prominent, 	delusions 	and	
hallucinations 	fleeting	and	fragmentary, 	behaviour 	irresponsible 	and	unpredictable, 	
and	mannerisms 	common.	The	mood	is	shallow	and	inappropriate, 	thought	is	
disorganized, 	and	speech	is	incoherent. 	There	is	a	tendency	to	social	isolation.	
Usually	the	prognosis 	is	poor	because	of	the	rapid	development 	of	‘negative’ 	
symptoms, 	particularly 	flattening 	of	affect	and	loss	of	volition.	Hebephrenia 	should	
normally	be	diagnosed 	only	in	adolescents 	or	young	adults.

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESF20.2  Catatonic schizophrenia
Catatonic 	schizophrenia 	is	dominated 	by	prominent 	psychomotor 	disturbances 	
that	may	alternate	between	extremes	such	as	hyperkinesis 	and	stupor,	or	automatic 	
obedience 	and	negativism. 	Constrained 	attitudes	and	postures	may	be	maintained 	
for	long	periods.	Episodes	of	violent	excitement 	may	be	a	striking	feature	of	the	
condition. 	The	catatonic	phenomena 	may	be	combined 	with	a	dream-like 	(oneiroid) 	
state	with	vivid	scenic	hallucinations.

F20.4  Post-schizophrenic depression
A	depressive 	episode,	which	may	be	prolonged, 	arising	in	the	aftermath 	of	
a	schizophrenic 	illness.	Some	schizophrenic 	symptoms, 	either	‘positive’ 	or	
‘negative’, 	must	still	be	present	but	they	no	longer	dominate	the	clinical	picture.	
These	depressive 	states	are	associated 	with	an	increased 	risk	of	suicide.	If	the	
patient	no	longer	has	any	schizophrenic 	symptoms, 	a	depressive 	episode	should	
be	diagnosed 	(F32.-).	If	schizophrenic 	symptoms 	are	still	florid	and	prominent, 	
the	diagnosis 	should	remain	that	of	the	appropriate 	schizophrenic 	subtype	(F20.0–
F20.3).
F20.5  Residual schizophrenia
A	chronic	stage	in	the	development 	of	a	schizophrenic 	illness	in	which	there	has	
been	a	clear	progression 	from	an	early	stage	to	a	later	stage	characterized 	by	long-	
term,	though	not	necessarily 	irreversible, 	‘negative’ 	symptoms, 	e.g.	psychomotor 	
slowing;	underactivity; 	blunting	of	affect;	passivity	and	lack	of	initiative; 	poverty	of	
quantity	or	content	of	speech;	poor	nonverbal 	communication 	by	facial	expression,

A	disorder	characterized 	by	the	development 	either	of	a	single	delusion	or	of	a

content	of	the	delusion	or	delusions 	is	very	variable.	Clear	and	persistent 	auditory	
hallucinations 	(voices),	schizophrenic 	symptoms 	such	as	delusions 	of	control	and	
marked	blunting	of	affect,	and	definite	evidence	of	brain	disease	are	all	incompatible 	
with	this	diagnosis. 	However, 	the	presence	of	occasional 	or	transitory 	auditory	
hallucinations, 	particularly 	in	elderly	patients,	does	not	rule	out	this	diagnosis,

development 	of	a	clearly	abnormal 	clinical	picture	in	about	two	weeks	or	less.	
For	these	disorders, 	there	is	no	evidence	of	organic	causation. 	Perplexity 	and	
puzzlement 	are	often	present	but	disorientation 	for	time,	place	and	person	is	not	
persistent 	or	severe	enough	to	justify	a	diagnosis 	of	organically 	caused	delirium

Mood [affective] disorders (F30–F39)
This	block	contains	disorders	in	which	the	fundamental 	disturbance 	is	a	change	in	affect	
or	mood,	to	depression 	(with	or	without	associated 	anxiety)	or	to	elation.	The	mood	
change	is	usually	accompanied 	by	a	change	in	the	overall	level	of	activity;	most	of	
the	other	symptoms 	are	either	secondary 	to,	or	easily	understood 	in	the	context	of,	the	
change	in	mood	and	activity.	Most	of	these	disorders	tend	to	be	recurrent	and	the	onset	
of	individual 	episodes	can	often	be	related	to	stressful	events	or	situations.

A	disorder	characterized 	by	a	persistent 	mild	elevation	of	mood,	increased 	energy	
and	activity,	and	usually	marked	feelings	of	well-being 	and	both	physical	and	
mental	efficiency. 	Increased 	sociability, 	talkativeness, 	over-familiarity, 	increased 	
sexual	energy	and	a	decreased 	need	for	sleep	are	often	present	but	not	to	the	extent	
that	they	lead	to	severe	disruption 	of	work	or	result	in	social	rejection.	Irritability, 	
conceit	and	boorish	behaviour 	may	take	the	place	of	the	more	usual	euphoric	
sociability. 	The	disturbances 	of	mood	and	behaviour 	are	not	accompanied 	by	
hallucinations 	or	delusions.

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESF30.1  Mania without psychotic symptoms
Mood	is	elevated	out	of	keeping	with	the	patient’s	circumstances 	and	may	vary	from	
carefree	joviality	to	almost	uncontrollable 	excitement. 	Elation	is	accompanied 	by	
increased 	energy,	resulting	in	overactivity, 	pressure	of	speech	and	a	decreased 	need	
for	sleep.	Attention 	cannot	be	sustained, 	and	there	is	often	marked	distractibility. 	
Self-esteem 	is	often	inflated,	with	grandiose 	ideas	and	overconfidence. 	Loss	of	
normal	social	inhibitions 	may	result	in	behaviour 	that	is	reckless,	foolhardy 	or	
inappropriate 	to	the	circumstances, 	and	out	of	character.
F30.2  Mania with psychotic symptoms
In	addition	to	the	clinical	picture	described 	in	F30.1,	delusions 	(usually	grandiose) 	
or	hallucinations 	(usually	of	voices	speaking	directly	to	the	patient)	are	present,	or	
the	excitement, 	excessive 	motor	activity	and	flight	of	ideas	are	so	extreme	that	the	
subject	is	incomprehensible 	or	inaccessible 	to	ordinary	communication.

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES  F32   Depressive episode
In	typical	mild,	moderate	or	severe	depressive 	episodes,	the	patient	suffers	from	
lowering	of	mood,	reduction 	of	energy	and	decrease	in	activity.	Capacity	for	
enjoyment, 	interest	and	concentration 	is	reduced,	and	marked	tiredness	after	even	
minimum 	effort	is	common.	Sleep	is	usually	disturbed	and	appetite	diminished. 	Self-
esteem	and	self-confidence 	are	almost	always	reduced	and,	even	in	the	mild	form,	
some	ideas	of	guilt	or	worthlessness 	are	often	present.	The	lowered	mood	varies	
little	from	day	to	day,	is	unresponsive 	to	circumstances 	and	may	be	accompanied 	
by	so-called	‘somatic’	symptoms, 	such	as	loss	of	interest	and	pleasurable 	feelings,	
waking	in	the	morning	several	hours	before	the	usual	time,	depression 	worst	in	the	
morning, marked psychomotor retardation, agitation, loss of appetite, weight loss, 
and	loss	of	libido.	Depending 	upon	the	number	and	severity	of	the	symptoms, 	a	
depressive 	episode	may	be	specified	as	mild,	moderate	or	severe.

elevation	and	increased 	energy	(mania).	There	may,	however,	be	brief	episodes	of	
mild	mood	elevation	and	overactivity 	(hypomania) 	immediately 	after	a	depressive 	
episode,	sometimes 	precipitated 	by	antidepressant 	treatment. 	The	more	severe	
forms	of	recurrent	depressive 	disorder	(F33.2	and	F33.3)	have	much	in	common	
with	earlier	concepts	such	as	manic-depressive 	depression, 	melancholia, 	vital	
depression 	and	endogenous 	depression. 	The	first	episode	may	occur	at	any	age	from	
childhood 	to	old	age,	the	onset	may	be	either	acute	or	insidious, 	and	the	duration	
varies	from	a	few	weeks	to	many	months.	The	risk	that	a	patient	with	recurrent	
depressive disorder will have an episode of mania never disappears completely,

A	group	of	disorders	in	which	anxiety	is	evoked	only,	or	predominantly, 	in	
certain	well-defined 	situations 	that	are	not	currently	dangerous. 	As	a	result,	these	
situations 	are	characteristically 	avoided	or	endured	with	dread.	The	patient’s	
concern	may	be	focused	on	individual 	symptoms 	like	palpitations 	or	feeling	faint	
and is often associated with secondary fears of dying, losing control, or going 
mad.	Contemplating 	entry	to	the	phobic	situation	usually	generates 	anticipatory 	
anxiety.	Phobic	anxiety	and	depression 	often	coexist.	Whether	two	diagnoses, 	
phobic	anxiety	and	depressive 	episode,	are	needed,	or	only	one,	is	determined 	by	
the	time	course	of	the	two	conditions 	and	by	therapeutic 	considerations 	at	the	time

disorder	is	a	frequent	feature	of	both	present	and	past	episodes.	Depressive 	and	
obsessional 	symptoms 	and	social	phobias	are	also	commonly 	present	as	subsidiary 	
features.	Avoidance 	of	the	phobic	situation	is	often	prominent, 	and	some	agoraphobics 	
experience 	little	anxiety	because	they	are	able	to	avoid	their	phobic	situations.

pervasive 	social	phobias	are	usually	associated 	with	low	self-esteem 	and	fear	of	
criticism.	They	may	present	as	a	complaint 	of	blushing,	hand	tremor,	nausea	or	
urgency	of	micturition, 	the	patient	sometimes 	being	convinced 	that	one	of	these

provided	that	they	are	clearly	secondary 	or	less	severe.
F41.0  Panic disorder [episodic paroxysmal anxiety]
The	essential	feature	is	recurrent	attacks	of	severe	anxiety	(panic),	which	are	not	
restricted	to	any	particular 	situation	or	set	of	circumstances 	and	are	therefore	
unpredictable. 	As	with	other	anxiety	disorders, 	the	dominant 	symptoms 	include	
sudden	onset	of	palpitations, 	chest	pain,	choking	sensations, 	dizziness	and	feelings	
of	unreality	(depersonalization 	or	derealization). 	There	is	often	also	a	secondary 	
fear	of	dying,	losing	control	or	going	mad.	Panic	disorder	should	not	be	given	as	the	
main	diagnosis 	if	the	patient	has	a	depressive 	disorder	at	the	time	the	attacks	start;

  F42   Obsessive-compulsive disorder
The	essential	feature	is	recurrent	obsessional 	thoughts	or	compulsive 	acts.	
Obsessional 	thoughts	are	ideas,	images	or	impulses	that	enter	the	patient’s	mind	
again	and	again	in	a	stereotyped 	form.	They	are	almost	invariably 	distressing 	and	
the	patient	often	tries,	unsuccessfully, 	to	resist	them.	They	are,	however,	recognized 	
as	his	or	her	own	thoughts,	even	though	they	are	involuntary 	and	often	repugnant. 	
Compulsive 	acts	or	rituals	are	stereotyped 	behaviours 	that	are	repeated	again	and

present.	If	compulsive 	acts	are	resisted,	the	anxiety	gets	worse.

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESF42.0  Predominantly obsessional thoughts or ruminations
These	may	take	the	form	of	ideas,	mental	images	or	impulses	to	act,	which	are	
nearly	always	distressing 	to	the	subject.	Sometimes 	the	ideas	are	an	indecisive, 	
endless consideration of alternatives, associated with an inability to make trivial 
but	necessary 	decisions	in	day-to-day 	living.	The	relationship 	between	obsessional 	
ruminations 	and	depression 	is	particularly 	close	and	a	diagnosis 	of	obsessive-
compulsive 	disorder	should	be	preferred	only	if	ruminations 	arise	or	persist	in	the	
absence	of	a	depressive 	episode.
F42.1  Predominantly compulsive acts [obsessional rituals]
The	majority	of	compulsive 	acts	are	concerned 	with	cleaning	(particularly 	
handwashing), 	repeated	checking	to	ensure	that	a	potentially 	dangerous 	situation	
has	not	been	allowed	to	develop,	or	orderliness 	and	tidiness.	Underlying 	the	overt	
behaviour 	is	a	fear,	usually	of	danger	either	to	or	caused	by	the	patient,	and	the	
ritual	is	an	ineffectual 	or	symbolic	attempt	to	avert	that	danger.
F42.2  Mixed obsessional thoughts and acts
F42.8  Other obsessive-compulsive disorders
F42.9  Obsessive-compulsive disorder, unspecified
  F43   Reaction to severe stress, and adjustment disorders
This	category	differs	from	others,	in	that	it	includes	disorders	identifiable 	on	the	
basis	of	not	only	symptoms 	and	course	but	also	the	existence	of	one	or	other	of	two	
causative	influences: 	an	exceptionally 	stressful	life	event	producing 	an	acute	stress	
reaction,	or	a	significant 	life	change	leading	to	continued 	unpleasant 	circumstances 	
that	result	in	an	adjustment 	disorder.	Although 	less	severe	psychosocial 	stress	(‘life	
events’)	may	precipitate 	the	onset	or	contribute 	to	the	presentation 	of	a	very	wide	
range	of	disorders	classified	elsewhere 	in	this	chapter,	its	etiological 	importance 	
is	not	always	clear	and	in	each	case	will	be	found	to	depend	on	individual, 	often	
idiosyncratic, 	vulnerability, 	i.e.	the	life	events	are	neither	necessary 	nor	sufficient	to	
explain	the	occurrence 	and	form	of	the	disorder.	In	contrast,	the	disorders	brought	
together	here	are	thought	to	arise	always	as	a	direct	consequence 	of	acute	severe	
stress	or	continued 	trauma.	The	stressful	events	or	the	continuing 	unpleasant 	
circumstances 	are	the	primary	and	overriding 	causal	factor	and	the	disorder	would	
not	have	occurred	without	their	impact.	The	disorders	in	this	section	can	thus	
be	regarded	as	maladaptive 	responses 	to	severe	or	continued 	stress,	in	that	they	
interfere	with	successful 	coping	mechanisms 	and	therefore	lead	to	problems	of	
social	functioning.
F43.0  Acute stress reaction
A	transient	disorder	that	develops	in	an	individual 	without	any	other	apparent	
mental	disorder,	in	response	to	exceptional 	physical	and	mental	stress	and	that	
usually	subsides	within	hours	or	days.	Individual 	vulnerability 	and	coping	capacity	
play	a	role	in	the	occurrence 	and	severity	of	acute	stress	reactions. 	The	symptoms 	
show	a	typically	mixed	and	changing	picture	and	include	an	initial	state	of	‘daze’,	
with	some	constriction 	of	the	field	of	consciousness 	and	narrowing 	of	attention,	
inability	to	comprehend 	stimuli,	and	disorientation. 	This	state	may	be	followed	
either	by	further	withdrawal 	from	the	surrounding 	situation	(to	the	extent	of	a	
dissociative 	stupor	–	F44.2),	or	by	agitation	and	overactivity 	(flight	reaction	or	
fugue).	Autonomic 	signs	of	panic	anxiety	(tachycardia, 	sweating, 	flushing)	are	
commonly 	present.	The	symptoms 	usually	appear	within	minutes	of	the	impact	of

Psychic shock
F43.1  Post-traumatic stress disorder
Arises	as	a	delayed	or	protracted 	response	to	a	stressful	event	or	situation	(of	
either	brief	or	long	duration)	of	an	exceptionally 	threatening 	or	catastrophic 	
nature,	which	is	likely	to	cause	pervasive 	distress	in	almost	anyone.	Predisposing 	
factors,	such	as	personality 	traits	(e.g.	compulsive, 	asthenic)	or	previous	history	
of	neurotic	illness,	may	lower	the	threshold	for	the	development 	of	the	syndrome 	
or	aggravate 	its	course,	but	they	are	neither	necessary 	nor	sufficient	to	explain	its	
occurrence. 	Typical	features	include	episodes	of	repeated	reliving	of	the	trauma	
in	intrusive	memories 	(‘flashbacks’), 	dreams	or	nightmares, 	occurring 	against	
the	persisting 	background 	of	a	sense	of	‘numbness’ 	and	emotional 	blunting,	
detachment 	from	other	people,	unresponsiveness 	to	surroundings, 	anhedonia, 	and	
avoidance 	of	activities	and	situations 	reminiscent 	of	the	trauma.	There	is	usually	a	
state	of	autonomic 	hyperarousal 	with	hypervigilance, 	an	enhanced 	startle	reaction,	
and	insomnia. 	Anxiety	and	depression 	are	commonly 	associated 	with	the	above	
symptoms 	and	signs,	and	suicidal	ideation	is	not	infrequent. 	The	onset	follows	
the	trauma	with	a	latency	period	that	may	range	from	a	few	weeks	to	months.	The	
course	is	fluctuating 	but	recovery	can	be	expected	in	the	majority	of	cases.	In	a	
small	proportion 	of	cases,	the	condition 	may	follow	a	chronic	course	over	many	
years,	with	eventual	transition 	to	an	enduring	personality 	change	(F62.0).
Traumatic 	neurosis
F43.2  Adjustment disorders
States	of	subjective 	distress	and	emotional 	disturbance, 	usually	interfering 	with	social	
functioning 	and	performance, 	arising	in	the	period	of	adaptation 	to	a	significant 	life	
change	or	a	stressful	life	event.	The	stressor	may	have	affected	the	integrity	of	an	
individual’s 	social	network	(bereavement, 	separation 	experiences) 	or	the	wider	system	
of	social	supports	and	values	(migration, 	refugee	status),	or	represented 	a	major	
developmental 	transition	or	crisis	(going	to	school,	becoming 	a	parent,	failure	to	attain	
a	cherished	personal	goal,	retirement). 	Individual 	predisposition 	or	vulnerability 	plays	
an	important 	role	in	the	risk	of	occurrence 	and	the	shaping	of	the	manifestations 	of	
adjustment 	disorders, 	but	it	is	nevertheless 	assumed	that	the	condition	would	not	
have	arisen	without	the	stressor.	The	manifestations 	vary	and	include	depressed 	
mood,	anxiety	or	worry	(or	mixture	of	these)	and	a	feeling	of	inability	to	cope,	plan	
ahead	or	continue	in	the	present	situation,	as	well	as	some	degree	of	disability	in	
the	performance 	of	daily	routine.	Conduct	disorders	may	be	an	associated 	feature,	
particularly 	in	adolescents. 	The	predominant 	feature	may	be	a	brief	or	prolonged 	
depressive 	reaction,	or	a	disturbance 	of	other	emotions	and	conduct.

  F44   Dissociative [conversion] disorders
The common themes that are shared by dissociative or conversion disorders are a partial or complete loss of the normal integration between memories of the past, 
awareness 	of	identity	and	immediate 	sensations, 	and	control	of	bodily	movements. 	
All	types	of	dissociative 	disorders	tend	to	remit	after	a	few	weeks	or	months,	
particularly 	if	their	onset	is	associated 	with	a	traumatic 	life	event.	More	chronic	
disorders, 	particularly 	paralyses	and	anaesthesias, 	may	develop	if	the	onset	is	
associated 	with	insoluble	problems	or	interpersonal 	difficulties. 	These	disorders	
have	previously 	been	classified	as	various	types	of	‘conversion 	hysteria’.	They	
are	presumed 	to	be	psychogenic 	in	origin,	being	associated 	closely	in	time	with	
traumatic 	events,	insoluble	and	intolerable 	problems, 	or	disturbed	relationships. 	
The	symptoms 	often	represent	the	patient’s	concept	of	how	a	physical	illness	would	
be	manifest.	Medical	examination 	and	investigation 	do	not	reveal	the	presence	of	
any	known	physical	or	neurological 	disorder.	In	addition,	there	is	evidence	that	the	
loss	of	function	is	an	expression 	of	emotional 	conflicts	or	needs.	The	symptoms 	may	
develop	in	close	relationship 	to	psychological 	stress,	and	often	appear	suddenly. 	
Only	disorders	of	physical	functions	normally	under	voluntary 	control,	and	loss	of	
sensations, 	are	included	here.	Disorders 	involving 	pain	and	other	complex	physical	
sensations, 	mediated	by	the	autonomic 	nervous	system	are	classified	under	
somatization 	disorder	(F45.0).	The	possibility 	of	the	later	appearance 	of	serious	
physical	or	psychiatric 	disorders	should	always	be	kept	in	mind.

F44.0  Dissociative amnesia
The	main	feature	is	loss	of	memory,	usually	of	important 	recent	events,	that	is	not	due	
to	organic	mental	disorder,	and	is	too	great	to	be	explained 	by	ordinary	forgetfulness 	
or	fatigue.	The	amnesia	is	usually	centred	on	traumatic	events,	such	as	accidents	
or	unexpected 	bereavements, 	and	is	usually	partial	and	selective.	Complete 	and	
generalized 	amnesia	is	rare,	and	is	usually	part	of	a	fugue	(F44.1).	If	this	is	the	case,	
the	disorder	should	be	classified	as	such.	The	diagnosis	should	not	be	made	in	the	
presence	of	organic	brain	disorders, 	intoxication 	or	excessive	fatigue.

Dissociative 	stupor	is	diagnosed 	on	the	basis	of	a	profound	diminution 	or	absence	
of	voluntary 	movement 	and	normal	responsiveness 	to	external	stimuli	such	as	light,	
noise	and	touch,	but	examination 	and	investigation 	reveal	no	evidence	of	a	physical

control,	i.e.	the	cardiovascular, 	gastrointestinal, 	respiratory 	and	urogenital 	systems.	
The	symptoms 	are	usually	of	two	types,	neither	of	which	indicates	a	physical

A	rare	disorder	in	which	the	patient	complains 	spontaneously 	that	his	or	her	
mental	activity,	body	and	surroundings 	are	changed	in	their	quality,	so	as	to	be	
unreal,	remote	or	automatized. 	Among	the	varied	phenomena 	of	the	syndrome, 	
patients	complain	most	frequently 	of	loss	of	emotions	and	feelings	of	estrangement 	
or	detachment 	from	their	thinking,	their	body	or	the	real	world.	In	spite	of	the	
dramatic	nature	of	the	experience, 	the	patient	is	aware	of	the	unreality	of	the	
change.	The	sensorium 	is	normal	and	the	capacity	for	emotional 	expression 	intact.

A	disorder	characterized 	by	deliberate 	weight	loss,	induced	and	sustained	by	
the	patient.	It	occurs	most	commonly 	in	adolescent 	girls	and	young	women,	but	
adolescent 	boys	and	young	men	may	also	be	affected,	as	may	children	approaching 	
puberty	and	older	women	up	to	the	menopause. 	The	disorder	is	associated 	with	a	
specific	psychopathology 	whereby	a	dread	of	fatness	and	flabbiness 	of	body	contour	
persists	as	an	intrusive	overvalued 	idea,	and	the	patients	impose	a	low	weight	
threshold	on	themselves. 	There	is	usually	undernutrition 	of	varying	severity,	with	
secondary 	endocrine 	and	metabolic 	changes	and	disturbances 	of	bodily	function.	
The	symptoms 	include	restricted	dietary	choice,	excessive 	exercise,	induced

F50.2  Bulimia nervosa
A	syndrome 	characterized 	by	repeated	bouts	of	overeating 	and	an	excessive 	
preoccupation 	with	the	control	of	body	weight,	leading	to	a	pattern	of	overeating 	
followed	by	vomiting	or	use	of	purgatives. 	This	disorder	shares	many	psychological 	
features	with	anorexia	nervosa,	including	an	overconcern 	with	body	shape	and	
weight.	Repeated	vomiting	is	likely	to	give	rise	to	disturbances 	of	body	electrolytes 	
and	physical	complications. 	There	is	often,	but	not	always,	a	history	of	an	earlier	
episode	of	anorexia	nervosa,	the	interval	ranging	from	a	few	months	to	several	years.

Hypersomnia 	is	defined	as	a	condition 	of	either	excessive 	daytime	sleepiness 	and	
sleep	attacks	(not	accounted 	for	by	an	inadequate 	amount	of	sleep)	or	prolonged 	
transition 	to	the	fully	aroused	state	upon	awakening. 	In	the	absence	of	an	organic

A	state	of	altered	consciousness 	in	which	phenomena 	of	sleep	and	wakefulness 	are	
combined. 	During	a	sleepwalking 	episode,	the	individual 	arises	from	bed,	usually	
during	the	first	third	of	nocturnal 	sleep,	and	walks	about,	exhibiting 	low	levels	of	
awareness, 	reactivity 	and	motor	skill.	Upon	awakening, 	there	is	usually	no	recall	
of	the	event.
F51.4  Sleep terrors [night terrors]
Nocturnal 	episodes	of	extreme	terror	and	panic	associated 	with	intense	vocalization, 	
motility	and	high	levels	of	autonomic 	discharge. 	The	individual 	sits	up	or	gets	up,	
usually	during	the	first	third	of	nocturnal 	sleep,	with	a	panicky	scream.	Quite	often,	
he	or	she	rushes	to	the	door	as	if	trying	to	escape,	although	very	seldom	leaves	the	
room.	Recall	of	the	event,	if	any,	is	very	limited	(usually	to	one	or	two	fragmentary

Dream	experiences 	loaded	with	anxiety	or	fear.	There	is	very	detailed	recall	
of	the	dream	content.	The	dream	experience 	is	very	vivid	and	usually	includes	
themes	involving 	threats	to	survival,	security	or	self-esteem. 	Quite	often,	there	is	
a	recurrence 	of	the	same	or	similar	frightening 	nightmare 	themes.	During	a	typical	
episode,	there	is	a	degree	of	autonomic 	discharge 	but	no	appreciable 	vocalization 	or

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESDisorders of adult personality and behaviour (F60–F69)
This	block	includes	a	variety	of	conditions 	and	behaviour 	patterns	of	clinical	significance 	
that	tend	to	be	persistent 	and	appear	to	be	the	expression 	of	the	individual’s 	characteristic 	
lifestyle	and	mode	of	relating	to	himself	or	herself	and	others.	Some	of	these	conditions 	
and	patterns	of	behaviour 	emerge	early	in	the	course	of	individual 	development, 	as	a	
result	of	both	constitutional 	factors	and	social	experience, 	while	others	are	acquired	
later	in	life.	Specific	personality 	disorders	(F60.-),	mixed	and	other	personality 	disorders	
(F61.-)	and	enduring	personality 	changes	(F62.-)	are	deeply	ingrained 	and	enduring	
behaviour 	patterns,	manifesting 	as	inflexible 	responses 	to	a	broad	range	of	personal	
and	social	situations. 	They	represent	extreme	or	significant 	deviations 	from	the	way	in	
which	the	average	individual 	in	a	given	culture	perceives, 	thinks,	feels	and,	particularly, 	
relates	to	others.	Such	behaviour 	patterns	tend	to	be	stable	and	to	encompass 	multiple	
domains	of	behaviour 	and	psychological 	functioning. 	They	are	frequently, 	but	not	
always,	associated 	with	various	degrees	of	subjective 	distress	and	problems	of	social	
performance.
  F60   Specific personality disorders
These	are	severe	disturbances 	in	the	personality 	and	behavioural 	tendencies 	of	the	
individual; 	not	directly	resulting	from	disease,	damage	or	other	insult	to	the	brain,	or	
from	another	psychiatric 	disorder;	usually	involving	several	areas	of	the	personality; 	
nearly	always	associated 	with	considerable 	personal	distress	and	social	disruption; 	and	
usually	manifest	since	childhood 	or	adolescence 	and	continuing 	throughout 	adulthood.
F60.0  Paranoid personality disorder
Personality 	disorder	characterized 	by	excessive	sensitivity 	to	setbacks;	unforgiveness 	
of	insults;	suspiciousness 	and	a	tendency	to	distort	experience 	by	misconstruing 	
the	neutral	or	friendly	actions	of	others	as	hostile	or	contemptuous; 	recurrent	
suspicions, 	without	justification, 	regarding 	the	sexual	fidelity	of	the	spouse	or	
sexual	partner;	and	a	combative 	and	tenacious 	sense	of	personal	rights.	There	may

Personality 	disorder	characterized 	by	a	definite	tendency	to	act	impulsively 	
and	without	consideration 	of	the	consequences; 	the	mood	is	unpredictable 	and	
capricious. 	There	is	a	liability	to	outbursts	of	emotion	and	an	incapacity 	to	control	
the	behavioural 	explosions. 	There	is	a	tendency	to	quarrelsome 	behaviour 	and	to	
conflicts	with	others,	especially 	when	impulsive 	acts	are	thwarted	or	censored. 	
Two	types	may	be	distinguished: 	the	impulsive 	type,	characterized 	predominantly

Personality 	change,	persisting 	for	at	least	two	years,	attributable 	to	the	traumatic 	
experience 	of	suffering	from	a	severe	psychiatric 	illness.	The	change	cannot	be

Reliance	on	some	non-living 	object	as	a	stimulus	for	sexual	arousal	and	sexual	
gratification. 	Many	fetishes	are	extensions 	of	the	human	body,	such	as	articles	of	
clothing	or	footwear.	Other	common	examples 	are	characterized 	by	some	particular 	
texture	such	as	rubber,	plastic	or	leather.	Fetish	objects	vary	in	their	importance 	
to	the	individual. 	In	some	cases	they	simply	serve	to	enhance	sexual	excitement 	
achieved	in	ordinary	ways	(e.g.	having	the	partner	wear	a	particular 	garment).
F65.1  Fetishistic transvestism
The	wearing	of	clothes	of	the	opposite	sex	principally 	to	obtain	sexual	excitement 	
and	to	create	the	appearance 	of	a	person	of	the	opposite	sex.	Fetishistic 	transvestism 	
is	distinguished 	from	transsexual 	transvestism 	by	its	clear	association 	with	sexual	
arousal	and	the	strong	desire	to	remove	the	clothing	once	orgasm	occurs	and	
sexual	arousal	declines.	It	can	occur	as	an	earlier	phase	in	the	development 	of	
transsexualism.
Transvestic fetishism
F65.2  Exhibitionism
A	recurrent	or	persistent 	tendency	to	expose	the	genitalia	to	strangers	(usually	of	
the	opposite	sex)	or	to	people	in	public	places,	without	inviting	or	intending 	closer	
contact.	There	is	usually,	but	not	invariably, 	sexual	excitement 	at	the	time	of	the

A	condition 	of	arrested	or	incomplete 	development 	of	the	mind,	which	is	especially 	characterized

occur	with	or	without	any	other	mental	or	physical	condition.

Intellectual 	abilities	and	social	adaptation 	may	change	over	time,	and,	however	poor,	may

childhood; 	(b)	impairment 	or	delay	in	development 	of	functions	that	are	strongly	related	to	
biological 	maturation 	of	the	central	nervous	system;	and	(c)	a	steady	course	without	remissions 	
and	relapses.	In	most	cases,	the	functions	affected	include	language, 	visuo-spatial 	skills	and	motor	
coordination. 	Usually,	the	delay	or	impairment 	has	been	present	from	as	early	as	it	could	be	
detected	reliably	and	will	diminish	progressively 	as	the	child	grows	older,	although	milder	deficits	
often	remain	in	adult	life.
  F80   Specific developmental disorders of speech and language
Disorders 	in	which	normal	patterns	of	language	acquisition 	are	disturbed	from	
the	early	stages	of	development. 	The	conditions 	are	not	directly	attributable 	to	
neurological 	or	speech-mechanism 	abnormalities, 	sensory	impairments, 	mental	
retardation 	or	environmental 	factors.	Specific	developmental 	disorders	of	speech	
and	language	are	often	followed	by	associated 	problems, 	such	as	difficulties 	in	
reading and spelling, abnormalities in interpersonal relationships, and emotional 
and	behavioural 	disorders.
F80.0  Specific speech articulation disorder
A	specific	developmental 	disorder	in	which	the	child’s	use	of	speech	sounds	is	
below	the	appropriate 	level	for	its	mental	age,	but	in	which	there	is	a	normal	level	
of	language	skills.

A	disorder	in	which	the	child,	having	previously 	made	normal	progress	in	language	
development, 	loses	both	receptive	and	expressive 	language	skills	but	retains	
general	intelligence; 	the	onset	of	the	disorder	is	accompanied 	by	paroxysmal 	
abnormalities 	on	the	EEG,	and,	in	the	majority	of	cases,	also	by	epileptic	seizures.	
Usually	the	onset	is	between	the	ages	of	three	and	seven	years,	with	skills	being	
lost	over	days	or	weeks.	The	temporal	association 	between	the	onset	of	seizures	and	
loss	of	language	is	variable,	with	one	preceding 	the	other	(either	way	round)	by	a	
few	months	to	two	years.	An	inflammatory 	encephalitic 	process	has	been	suggested 	
as	a	possible	cause	of	this	disorder.	About	two	thirds	of	patients	are	left	with	a	more	
or	less	severe	receptive	language	deficit.

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES  F81   Specific developmental disorders of scholastic skills
Disorders 	in	which	the	normal	patterns	of	skill	acquisition 	are	disturbed	from	
the	early	stages	of	development. 	This	is	not	simply	a	consequence 	of	a	lack	of	
opportunity 	to	learn,	it	is	not	solely	a	result	of	mental	retardation, 	and	it	is	not	due	
to	any	form	of	acquired	brain	trauma	or	disease.
F81.0  Specific reading disorder
The	main	feature	is	a	specific	and	significant 	impairment 	in	the	development 	of	
reading	skills	that	is	not	solely	accounted 	for	by	mental	age,	visual	acuity	problems	
or	inadequate 	schooling. 	Reading	comprehension 	skill,	reading	word	recognition, 	
oral	reading	skill	and	performance 	of	tasks	requiring	reading	may	all	be	affected.	
Spelling	difficulties 	are	frequently 	associated 	with	specific	reading	disorder	and	
often remain into adolescence, even after some progress in reading has been 
made.	Specific	developmental 	disorders	of	reading	are	commonly 	preceded	by	a	
history	of	disorders	in	speech	or	language	development. 	Associated 	emotional 	and	
behavioural 	disturbances 	are	common	during	the	school	age	period.

The	main	feature	is	a	specific	and	significant 	impairment 	in	the	development 	of	spelling	
skills,	in	the	absence	of	a	history	of	specific	reading	disorder,	which	is	not	solely	
accounted 	for	by	low	mental	age,	visual	acuity	problems	or	inadequate 	schooling. 	The	
abilities	to	spell	orally	and	to	write	out	words	correctly	are	both	affected.

F81.2  Specific disorder of arithmetical skills
Involves	a	specific	impairment 	in	arithmetical 	skills	that	is	not	solely	explicable 	
on	the	basis	of	general	mental	retardation 	or	of	inadequate 	schooling. 	The	
deficit	concerns	mastery	of	basic	computational 	skills	of	addition,	subtraction, 	
multiplication 	and	division,	rather	than	of	the	more	abstract	mathematical 	skills	
involved	in	algebra,	trigonometry, 	geometry 	or	calculus.

coordination 	that	is	not	solely	explicable 	in	terms	of	general	intellectual 	retardation 	or	of	
any	specific	congenital 	or	acquired	neurological 	disorder.	Nevertheless, 	in	most	cases,	
a	careful	clinical	examination 	shows	marked	neurodevelopmental 	immaturities 	such	as

diagnosis. 	This	mixed	category	should	be	used	only	when	there	is	a	major	overlap	
between	each	of	these	specific	developmental 	disorders. 	The	disorders	are	usually,	
but	not	always,	associated 	with	some	degree	of	general	impairment 	of	cognitive

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES  F84   Pervasive developmental disorders
A	group	of	disorders	characterized 	by	qualitative 	abnormalities 	in	reciprocal 	social	
interactions 	and	in	patterns	of	communication, 	and	by	a	restricted, 	stereotyped, 	
repetitive 	repertoire 	of	interests	and	activities. 	These	qualitative 	abnormalities 	are	a	
pervasive 	feature	of	the	individual’s 	functioning 	in	all	situations.
Use	additional 	code,	if	desired,	to	identify	any	associated 	medical	
condition 	and	mental	retardation.
F84.0  Childhood autism
A	type	of	pervasive 	developmental 	disorder	that	is	defined	by:	(a)	the	presence	of	
abnormal or impaired development that is manifest before the age of three years, 
and	(b)	the	characteristic 	type	of	abnormal 	functioning 	in	all	the	three	areas	of	
psychopathology: 	reciprocal 	social	interaction, 	communication 	and	restricted, 	
stereotyped, 	repetitive 	behaviour. 	In	addition	to	these	specific	diagnostic 	features,	
a	range	of	other	nonspecific 	problems	are	common,	such	as	phobias,	sleeping	and	
eating	disturbances, 	temper	tantrums	and	(self-directed) 	aggression.
Autistic	disorder
Infantile:
• autism
• psychosisKanner syndromeExcl.:
	 autistic	psychopathy 	(F84.5)	
F84.1  Atypical autism
A	type	of	pervasive 	developmental 	disorder	that	differs	from	childhood 	autism,	
either	in	age	of	onset	or	in	failing	to	fulfil	all	three	sets	of	diagnostic 	criteria.	This	
subcategory 	should	be	used	when	there	is	abnormal 	and	impaired	development 	
that	is	present	only	after	age	three	years,	and	a	lack	of	sufficient	demonstrable 	
abnormalities 	in	one	or	two	of	the	three	areas	of	psychopathology 	required	for	
the	diagnosis 	of	autism	(namely,	reciprocal 	social	interactions, 	communication 	and	
restricted, 	stereotyped, 	repetitive 	behaviour) 	in	spite	of	characteristic 	abnormalities 	
in	the	other	area(s).	Atypical	autism	arises	most	often	in	profoundly 	retarded	
individuals 	and	in	individuals 	with	a	severe	specific	developmental 	disorder	of	
receptive	language.
Atypical	childhood 	psychosis
Mental	retardation 	with	autistic	features
Use	additional 	code	(F70–F79), 	if	desired,	to	identify	mental	retardation.
F84.2  Rett syndrome
A	condition, 	so	far	found	only	in	girls,	in	which	apparently 	normal	early	development 	
is	followed	by	partial	or	complete	loss	of	speech	and	of	skills	in	locomotion 	and	use	
of	hands,	together	with	deceleration 	in	head	growth,	usually	with	an	onset	between	
seven	and	24	months	of	age.	Loss	of	purposive 	hand	movements, 	hand-wringing 	
stereotypies, 	and	hyperventilation 	are	characteristic. 	Social	and	play	development 	
are	arrested	but	social	interest	tends	to	be	maintained. 	Trunk	ataxia	and	apraxia	
start	to	develop	by	age	four	years	and	choreoathetoid 	movements 	frequently 	follow.

A	type	of	pervasive 	developmental 	disorder	that	is	defined	by	a	period	of	entirely	
normal	development 	before	the	onset	of	the	disorder,	followed	by	a	definite	loss	
of	previously 	acquired	skills	in	several	areas	of	development 	over	the	course	of	
a	few	months.	Typically, 	this	is	accompanied 	by	a	general	loss	of	interest	in	the	
environment, 	by	stereotyped, 	repetitive 	motor	mannerisms, 	and	by	autistic-like 	
abnormalities 	in	social	interaction 	and	communication. 	In	some	cases	the	disorder	
can	be	shown	to	be	due	to	some	associated 	encephalopathy 	but	the	diagnosis 	should

F84.4  Overactive disorder associated with mental retardation and 
stereotyped movements
An	ill-defined 	disorder	of	uncertain	nosological 	validity.	The	category	is	designed	
to	include	a	group	of	children	with	severe	mental	retardation 	(IQ	below	35)	who	
show major problems in hyperactivity and in attention, as well as stereotyped 
behaviours. 	They	tend	not	to	benefit	from	stimulant	drugs	(unlike	those	with	an	IQ	
in	the	normal	range)	and	may	exhibit	a	severe	dysphoric 	reaction	(sometimes 	with	
psychomotor 	retardation) 	when	given	stimulants. 	In	adolescence, 	the	overactivity 	
tends	to	be	replaced	by	underactivity 	(a	pattern	that	is	not	usual	in	hyperkinetic 	
children	with	normal	intelligence). 	This	syndrome 	is	also	often	associated 	with	a	
variety	of	developmental 	delays,	either	specific	or	global.	The	extent	to	which	the	
behavioural 	pattern	is	a	function	of	low	IQ	or	of	organic	brain	damage	is	not	known.
F84.5  Asperger syndrome
A	disorder	of	uncertain	nosological 	validity,	characterized 	by	the	same	type	of	
qualitative 	abnormalities 	of	reciprocal 	social	interaction 	that	typify	autism,	together	
with	a	restricted, 	stereotyped, 	repetitive 	repertoire 	of	interests	and	activities. 	It	
differs	from	autism	primarily	in	the	fact	that	there	is	no	general	delay	or	retardation 	
in	language	or	in	cognitive	development. 	This	disorder	is	often	associated 	with	
marked	clumsiness. 	There	is	a	strong	tendency	for	the	abnormalities 	to	persist	into	
adolescence 	and	adult	life.	Psychotic 	episodes	occasionally 	occur	in	early	adult	life.

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESBehavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence (F90–F98)
  F90   Hyperkinetic disorders
A	group	of	disorders	characterized 	by	an	early	onset	(usually	in	the	first	five	years	
of	life),	lack	of	persistence 	in	activities	that	require	cognitive	involvement, 	and	a	
tendency	to	move	from	one	activity	to	another	without	completing 	any	one,	together	
with	disorganized, 	ill-regulated, 	and	excessive 	activity.	Several	other	abnormalities 	
may	be	associated. 	Hyperkinetic 	children	are	often	reckless,	impulsive 	and	prone	
to	accidents, 	and	find	themselves 	in	disciplinary 	trouble	because	of	unthinking 	
breaches	of	rules	rather	than	deliberate 	defiance.	Their	relationships 	with	adults	
are	often	socially	disinhibited, 	with	a	lack	of	normal	caution	and	reserve.	They	are	
unpopular 	with	other	children	and	may	become	isolated.	Impairment 	of	cognitive	
functions	is	common,	and	specific	delays	in	motor	and	language	development 	are	
disproportionately 	frequent.	Secondary 	complications 	include	dissocial	behaviour 	
and	low	self-esteem.

appropriate 	social	expectations; 	it	should	therefore	be	more	severe	than	ordinary	
childish	mischief	or	adolescent 	rebelliousness 	and	should	imply	an	enduring	
pattern	of	behaviour 	(six	months	or	longer).	Features	of	conduct	disorder	can	
also	be	symptomatic 	of	other	psychiatric 	conditions, 	in	which	case	the	underlying 	
diagnosis 	should	be	preferred.

of	the	nuclear	family	or	immediate 	household. 	The	disorder	requires	that	the	overall

acts	or	the	more	extreme	forms	of	aggressive 	or	dissocial	behaviour. 	The	disorder	
requires	that	the	overall	criteria	for	F91.-	be	met;	even	severely	mischievous 	or	naughty	
behaviour 	is	not	in	itself	sufficient	for	diagnosis. 	Caution	should	be	employed 	before	
using	this	category,	especially 	with	older	children,	because	clinically	significant 	
conduct	disorder	will	usually	be	accompanied 	by	dissocial	or	aggressive 	behaviour

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESF94.1  Reactive attachment disorder of childhood
Starts	in	the	first	five	years	of	life	and	is	characterized 	by	persistent 	abnormalities 	in	the	
child’s	pattern	of	social	relationships 	that	are	associated 	with	emotional 	disturbance 	
and	are	reactive	to	changes	in	environmental 	circumstances 	(e.g.	fearfulness 	and	
hypervigilance, poor social interaction with peers, aggression towards self and 
others,	misery,	and	growth	failure	in	some	cases).	The	syndrome 	probably	occurs	as	
a	direct	result	of	severe	parental	neglect,	abuse	or	serious	mishandling.
Use	additional 	code,	if	desired,	to	identify	any	associated 	failure	to	thrive	
or	growth	retardation.

sexual	or	physical	abuse	in	childhood, 	resulting	in	psychosocial 	
problems	(Z61.4–Z61.6) 	
F94.2  Disinhibited attachment disorder of childhood
A	particular 	pattern	of	abnormal 	social	functioning 	that	arises	during	the	first	five	
years of life and that tends to persist despite marked changes in environmental 
circumstances, 	e.g.	diffuse,	nonselectively 	focused	attachment 	behaviour, 	
attention-seeking 	and	indiscriminately 	friendly	behaviour, 	poorly	modulated 	peer	
interactions; 	depending 	on	circumstances, 	there	may	also	be	associated 	emotional

  F95   Tic disorders
Syndromes 	in	which	the	predominant 	manifestation 	is	some	form	of	tic.	A	tic	is	
an	involuntary, 	rapid,	recurrent, 	nonrhythmic 	motor	movement 	(usually	involving 	
circumscribed 	muscle	groups)	or	vocal	production 	that	is	of	sudden	onset	and	
that	serves	no	apparent	purpose.	Tics	tend	to	be	experienced 	as	irresistible 	but	
usually	they	can	be	suppressed 	for	varying	periods	of	time,	are	exacerbated 	by	
stress,	and	disappear 	during	sleep.	Common 	simple	motor	tics	include	only	eye-
blinking,	neck-jerking, 	shoulder-shrugging 	and	facial	grimacing. 	Common 	simple	
vocal	tics	include	throat-clearing, 	barking,	sniffing	and	hissing.	Common 	complex	
tics	include	hitting	oneself,	jumping	and	hopping.	Common 	complex	vocal	tics	
include	the	repetition 	of	particular 	words,	and	sometimes 	the	use	of	socially	
unacceptable 	(often	obscene)	words	(coprolalia) 	and	the	repetition 	of	one’s	own	
sounds	or	words	(palilalia).

F95.1  Chronic motor or vocal tic disorder
Meets	the	general	criteria	for	a	tic	disorder,	in	which	there	are	motor	or	vocal	tics	
(but	not	both),	that	may	be	either	single	or	multiple	(but	usually	multiple)	and	last	
for	more	than	a	year.
F95.2  Combined vocal and multiple motor tic disorder [Tourette]
A	form	of	tic	disorder	in	which	there	are,	or	have	been,	multiple	motor	tics	and	
one	or	more	vocal	tics,	although	these	need	not	have	occurred	concurrently. 	The	
disorder	usually	worsens	during	adolescence 	and	tends	to	persist	into	adult	life.	The	
vocal	tics	are	often	multiple,	with	explosive 	repetitive 	vocalizations, 	throat-clearing 	
and	grunting,	and	there	may	be	the	use	of	obscene	words	or	phrases.	Sometimes

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESF98.1  Nonorganic encopresis
Repeated, 	voluntary 	or	involuntary 	passage	of	faeces,	usually	of	normal	or	near-
normal	consistency, 	in	places	not	appropriate 	for	that	purpose	in	the	individual’s

of normal infantile incontinence, it may involve a loss of continence following the 
acquisition 	of	bowel	control,	or	it	may	involve	the	deliberate 	deposition 	of	faeces	in	
inappropriate 	places	in	spite	of	normal	physiological 	bowel	control.	The	condition 	
may	occur	as	a	monosymptomatic 	disorder,	or	it	may	form	part	of	a	wider	disorder,

F98.2  Feeding disorder of infancy and childhood
A	feeding	disorder	of	varying	manifestations, 	usually	specific	to	infancy	and	early	
childhood. 	It	generally	involves	food	refusal	and	extreme	faddiness 	in	the	presence	
of	an	adequate	food	supply,	a	reasonably 	competent 	caregiver, 	and	the	absence	
of	organic	disease.	There	may	or	may	not	be	associated 	rumination 	(repeated

F98.3  Pica of infancy and childhood
Persistent 	eating	of	non-nutritive 	substances 	(such	as	soil,	paint	chippings, 	etc.).	It	
may	occur	as	one	of	many	symptoms 	that	are	part	of	a	more	widespread 	psychiatric

For characterizing visual impairment for codes H54.4–H54.6, visual acuity should be measured monocularly with presenting correction if any.If the extent of the visual field is taken into account, patients with a visual field of the better eye no greater than 10° in radius around central fixation should be placed under category 3. For monocular blindness (H54.4), this degree of field loss would apply to the affected eye.

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESNote: The term visual impairment in category H54 comprises category 0 for mild or no visual impairment, category 1 for moderate visual impairment, category 2 for severe visual impairment, categories 3, 4 and 5 for blindness and category 9 for unqualified visual impairment. The term ‘low vision’ included in the previous revision has been replaced by categories 1 and 2, to avoid confusion with those requiring low vision care.

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESArthropathies (M00–M25)
Incl.:  disorders affecting predominantly peripheral (limb) joints
Infectious arthropathies (M00–M03)
Note:  This block comprises arthropathies due to microbiological agents.
Distinction is made between the following types of etiological relationship:
a) direct infection of joint, where organisms invade synovial tissue and microbial antigen is present in the joint;
b) indirect infection, which may be of two types: a reactive arthropathy, where microbial infection of the body is established but neither organisms nor antigens can be identified in the joint, and a postinfective arthropathy, where microbial antigen is present but recovery of an organism is inconstant and evidence of local multiplication is lacking.

Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified (R00–R99)
This chapter includes symptoms, signs, abnormal results of clinical or other investigative procedures, and ill-defined conditions regarding which no diagnosis classifiable elsewhere is recorded.Signs and symptoms that point rather definitely to a given diagnosis have been assigned to a category in other chapters of the classification. In general, categories in this chapter include the less well-defined conditions and symptoms that, without the necessary study of the case to establish a final diagnosis, point perhaps equally to two or more diseases or to two or more systems of the body. Practically all categories in the chapter could be designated ‘not otherwise specified’, ‘unknown etiology’ or ‘transient’. The Alphabetical index should be consulted to determine which symptoms and signs are to be allocated here and which to other chapters. The residual subcategories, numbered .8, are generally provided for other relevant symptoms that cannot be allocated elsewhere in the classification.The conditions and signs or symptoms included in categories R00–R99 consist of:
a) cases for which no more specific diagnosis can be made even after all the facts bearing on the case have been investigated;
b) signs or symptoms existing at the time of initial encounter that proved to be transient and whose causes could not be determined;
c) provisional diagnoses in a patient who failed to return for further investigation or care;
d) cases referred elsewhere for investigation or treatment before the diagnosis was made;
e) cases in which a more precise diagnosis was not available for any other reason;
f) certain symptoms, for which supplementary information is provided, that represent important problems in medical care in their own right.Excl.:
 abnormal findings on antenatal screening of mother (O28.-)

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESThe chapter uses the S-section for coding different types of injuries related to single 
body	regions	and	the	T-section	to	cover	injuries	to	multiple	or	unspecified 	body	regions,	
as well as poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes.
Where	multiple	sites	of	injury	are	specified	in	the	titles,	the	word	‘with’	indicates	
involvement 	of	both	sites,	and	the	word	‘and’	indicates	involvement 	of	either	or	both	sites.
The principle of multiple coding of injuries should be followed wherever possible. Combination categories for multiple injuries are provided for use when there is 
insufficient 	detail	as	to	the	nature	of	the	individual 	conditions, 	or	for	primary	tabulation 	
purposes when it is more convenient to record a single code; otherwise, the component injuries should be coded separately. Reference should also be made to the morbidity or mortality coding rules and guidelines in V olume 2.The blocks of the S-section as well as T00–T14 and T90–T98 contain injuries at the 
three-character 	level	classified	by	type	as	follows:
Superficial injury 	including:  
 •abrasion
 •blister (nonthermal)
 •contusion, including bruise and haematoma
 •injury	from	superficial 	foreign	body	(splinter)	without	major	open	wound

External causes of morbidity and mortality (V01–Y98)
This chapter, which in previous revisions of the ICD constituted a supplementary classification, permits the classification of environmental events and circumstances as the cause of injury, poisoning and other adverse effects. Where a code from this section is applicable, it is intended that it will be used in addition to a code from another chapter of the classification indicating the nature of the condition. Most often, the condition will be classifiable to Chapter XIX, Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes (S00–T98). Causes of death should preferably be tabulated according to both Chapter XIX and Chapter XX, but if only one code is tabulated, then the code from Chapter XX should be used in preference. Other conditions that may be stated to be due to external causes are classified in Chapters I to XVIII. For these conditions, codes from Chapter XX should be used to provide additional information for multiple-condition analysis only.Categories for sequelae of external causes of morbidity and mortality are included at Y85–Y89.This chapter contains the following blocks:
V01–X59  Accidents
V01–V99  Transport accidents
V01–V09  Pedestrian injured in transport accident
V10–V19  Pedal cyclist injured in transport accident
V20–V29  Motorcycle rider injured in transport accident
V30–V39  Occupant of three-wheeled motor vehicle injured 
in transport accident
V40–V49  Car occupant injured in transport accident
V50–V59  Occupant of pick-up truck or van injured in 
transport accident
V60–V69  Occupant of heavy transport vehicle injured in 
transport accident
V70–V79  Bus occupant injured in transport accident
V80–V89  Other land transport accidents
V90–V94  Water transport accidents
V95–V97  Air and space transport accidents
V98–V99  Other and unspecified transport accidents
W00–X59  Other external causes of accidental injury

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESAccidents (V01–X59)
Transport accidents (V01–V99)
Note:  This section is structured in 12 groups. Those relating to land transport 
accidents (V01–V89) reflect the victim’s mode of transport and are subdivided to identify the victim’s ‘counterpart’ or the type of event. The vehicle of which the injured person is an occupant is identified in the first two characters, since it is seen as the most important factor to identify for prevention purposes.Excl.:
 accidents to persons engaged in the maintenance or repair of transport equipment or vehicle (not in motion) unless injured by another vehicle in motion (W00–X59)
 accidents involving vehicles, but unrelated to the hazards associated with 
the means of transportation, e.g., injuries received in a fight on board ship; transport vehicle involved in a cataclysm; finger crushed when shutting car door (W00–X59) assault by crashing of motor vehicle (Y03) event of undetermined intent (Y31–Y33) intentional self-harm (X81–X83) 
Definitions related to transport accidents
a) A transport accident  (V01–V99) is any accident involving a device designed primarily for, or being used at the time primarily for, conveying persons or goods from one place to another.
b) A public highway [trafficway] or street is the entire width between property lines (or other boundary lines) of land open to the public as a matter of right or custom, for purposes of moving persons or property from one place to another. A roadway is that part of the public highway designed, improved and customarily used for vehicular traffic. 
c) A traffic accident is any vehicle accident occurring on the public highway [i.e. originating on, terminating on, or involving a vehicle partially on the highway]. A vehicle accident is assumed to have occurred on the public highway unless another place is specified, except in the case of accidents involving only off-road motor vehicles, which are classified as nontraffic accidents unless the contrary is stated.

Classification and coding instructions for transport accidents
1. If an event is unspecified as to whether it was a traffic or a nontraffic accident, it 
is assumed to be:
a) a traffic accident when the event is classifiable to categories V10–V82 and 
V87.
b) a nontraffic accident when the event is classifiable to categories V83–V86. 
For these categories, the victim is either a pedestrian or an occupant of a vehicle designed primarily for off-road use.
2. When accidents involving more than one kind of transport are reported, the 
following order of precedence should be used:
 aircraft and spacecraft (V95–V97)
 watercraft (V90–V94)
 other modes of transport (V01–V89, V98–V99)

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESIf more than one vehicle is mentioned, do not make any assumption as to which vehicle was occupied by the victim unless the vehicles are the same. Instead, code to the appropriate categories V87–V88, V90–V94, V95–V97, taking into account the order of precedence given in note 2 above.
5. Where a transport accident, such as:
vehicle (motor)(nonmotor):
• failing to make curve
• going out of control (due to):
 –burst tyre [blowout]
 –driver falling asleep
 –driver inattention
 –excessive speedfailure of mechanical partresulted in a subsequent collision, classify the accident as a collision. If an accident other than a collision resulted, classify it as a noncollision accident, according to the vehicle type involved.
6. Where a transport accident involving a vehicle in motion, such as:
accidental poisoning from exhaust gas generated bybreakage of any part ofexplosion of any part offall, jump or being accidentally pushed fromfire starting inhit by object thrown into or ontoinjured by being thrown against some part of, or object ininjury from moving part of

Factors influencing health status and contact with health services (Z00–Z99)
Note:  This chapter should not be used for international comparison or for primary 
mortality coding.
 Categories Z00–Z99 are provided for occasions when circumstances other 
than a disease, injury or external cause classifiable to categories A00–Y89 are recorded as ‘diagnoses’ or ‘problems’. This can arise in two main ways:
a)  When a person who may or may not be sick encounters the health 
services for some specific purpose, such as to receive limited care or service for a current condition, to donate an organ or tissue, to receive prophylactic vaccination or to discuss a problem which is in itself not a disease or injury.
b) When some circumstance or problem is present which influences the 
person’s health status but is not in itself a current illness or injury. Such factors may be elicited during population surveys, when the person may or may not be currently sick, or be recorded as an additional factor to be borne in mind when the person is receiving care for some illness or injury.This chapter contains the following blocks:
Z00–Z13  Persons encountering health services for examination and investigation
Z20–Z29  Persons with potential health hazards related to communicable diseases
Z30–Z39  Persons encountering health services in circumstances related to reproduction
Z40–Z54  Persons encountering health services for specific procedures and health care
Z55–Z65  Persons with potential health hazards related to socioeconomic and 
psychosocial circumstances
Z70–Z76  Persons encountering health services in other circumstances
Z80–Z99  Persons with potential health hazards related to family and personal

Morphology of neoplasms
The morphology of neoplasms is coded using the International classification of diseases for oncology (ICD-O).  Its morphology list was formerly included in ICD-10, but became outdated soon, owing to the updates of ICD-O.  As a result, it was decided to discontinue the inclusion of ICD-O codes in ICD-10 from 2016.  Interested users can download the ICD-O lists from the classification website of WHO (www.who.int/classifications).ICD-O is used mostly in tumour or cancer registries for coding the site (topography) and the histology (morphology) of neoplasms, usually obtained from a pathology report.ICD-O is a multi-axial classification of the site, morphology, behaviour and grading of neoplasms.The topography axis uses the ICD-10 classification of malignant neoplasms (except those categories that relate to secondary neoplasms and to specified morphological types of tumours) for all types of tumours, thereby providing greater site detail for non-malignant tumours than is provided in ICD-10. In contrast to ICD-10, ICD-O includes topography for sites of haematopoietic and reticuloendothelial tumours.The morphology axis provides five-digit codes ranging from M-8000/0 to M-9989/3. The first four digits indicate the specific histological term. The fifth digit after the slash (/) is the behaviour code, which indicates whether a tumour is malignant, benign, in situ or uncertain (whether benign or malignant).A separate one-digit code is also provided for histologic grading (differentiation).The one-digit behaviour code is as follows:
/0   Benign
/1  Uncertain whether benign or malignant
Borderline malignancy1 Low malignant potential
1
/2   Intraepithelial
Noninfiltrating Noninvasive
/3   Malignant, primary site
/6   Malignant, metastatic site
Malignant, secondary site
/9   Malignant, uncertain whether primary or metastatic site
Morphology of neoplasms
1 Except cystadenomas of ovary in M844–M849, which are considered to be ma lignant.

Behaviour code Chapter II  categories /0Benign neoplasms D10–D36 /1Neoplasms of uncertain and unknown behaviour D37–D48 /2In situ neoplasms D00–D09 /3Malignant neoplasms, stated or  presumed to be primary C00–C76, C80–C97 /6 Malignant neoplasms, stated or  presumed to be secondary C77–C79 
 
The ICD-O behaviour digit /9 is not applicable in the ICD context, since all malignant neoplasms are presumed to be primary (/3) or secondary (/6), according to other information on the medical record.Only the first-listed term of the full ICD-O morphology nomenclature appears against each code number in the list given here. Some types of neoplasm are specific to certain sites or types of tissue. For example, nephroblastoma, by definition, always arises in the kidney; hepatocellular carcinoma is always primary in the liver; and basal cell carcinoma usually arises in the skin. For such terms, the appropriate site code has been added in parentheses in ICD-O. The appropriate fourth character for the reported site should be used. The ICD-O site codes assigned to the morphologic terms can be used when the site of the neoplasm is not given in the diagnosis. In ICD-O, site codes have not been assigned to many of the morphology terms because the histologic types can arise in more than one organ or type of tissue.For further detail about the coding of morphology refer to ICD-O. Coded nomenclature for morphology of neoplasmsThis is no longer supported in ICD-10 since 2016.Currently, ICD-10 still mentions ICD-O codes in its three volumes.  These codes need to be verified against the most recent version of ICD-O.

Note:  These definitions have been adopted by the World Health Assembly (resolutions WHA20.19 and WHA43.24) under Article 23 of the Constitution of the World Health Organization.
1. Causes of death
The causes of death to be entered on the medical certificate of cause of death are all those diseases, morbid conditions or injuries that either resulted in or contributed to death and the circumstances of the accident or violence that resulted in any such injuries.
2. Underlying cause of death
The underlying cause of death is (a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury.
3.	 Definitions 	in	relation	to	fetal,	perinatal, 	neonatal	and	infant	
mortality
3.1. Live birth
Live birth is the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached; each product of such a birth is considered liveborn.
3.2. Fetal death [deadborn fetus]
Fetal death is death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy; the death is indicated by the fact that after such separation the fetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles.
3.3. Birth weight
The first weight of the fetus or neonate obtained after birth.
3.4. Low birth weight
Less than 2500 g (up to, and including, 2499 g)

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES3.5. Very low birth weight
Less than 1500 g (up to, and including 1499 g).
3.6. Extremely low birth weight
Less than 1000 g (up to, and including, 999 g)
3.7. Gestational age
The duration of gestation is measured from the first day of the last normal menstrual period. Gestational age is expressed in completed days or completed weeks  (e.g. events occurring 280 to 286 completed days after the onset of the last normal menstrual period are considered to have occurred at 40 weeks of gestation).
3.8. Pre-term
Less than 37 completed weeks (less than 259 days) of gestation
3.9. Term
From 37 completed weeks to less than 42 completed weeks (259 to 293 days) of gestation
3.10.  Post-term
42 completed weeks or more (294 days or more) of gestation
3.11.  Perinatal period
The perinatal period commences at 22 completed weeks (154 days) of gestation (the time when birth weight is normally 500 g), and ends seven completed days after birth.
3.12.  Neonatal period
The neonatal period commences at birth and ends 28 completed days after birth. Neonatal deaths (deaths among live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first seven days of life, and late neonatal deaths, occurring after the seventh day but before 28 completed days of life.
Vol1_B&W.indb   1068 15/09/15   12:09",1071
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"DEFINITIONS1069Notes on definitionsi. For live births, birth weight should preferably be measured within the first 
hour of life before significant postnatal weight loss has occurred. While statistical tabulations include 500g groupings for birth weight, weights should not be recorded in those groupings. The actual weight should be recorded to the degree of accuracy to which it is measured.
ii. The definitions of ‘low’, ‘very low’, and ‘extremely low’ birth weight do not 
constitute mutually exclusive categories. Below the set limits, they are all-inclusive and therefore overlap (i.e. ‘low’ includes ‘very low’ and ‘extremely low’, while ‘very low’ includes ‘extremely low’).
iii. Gestational age is frequently a source of confusion when calculations are 
based on menstrual dates. For the purposes of calculation of gestational age from the date of the first day of the last normal menstrual period and the date of delivery, it should be borne in mind that the first day is day 0 and not day 1; days 0–6 therefore correspond to ‘completed week 0’, days 7–13 to ‘completed week 1’, and the 40th week of actual gestation is synonymous with ‘completed week 39’. Where the date of the last normal menstrual period is not available, gestational age should be based on the best clinical estimate. In order to avoid misunderstanding, tabulations should indicate both weeks and days.
iv. Age at death during the first day of life (day 0) should be recorded in units of 
completed minutes or hours of life. For the second (day 1), third (day 2) and through 27 completed days of life, age at death should be recorded in days.

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESRegulations regarding nomenclatureMaternal de aths should be subdivided into two groups:
4.4. Direct obstetric deaths
Direct obstetric deaths are those resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnant state (pregnancy, labour and puerperium), from interventions, omissions or incorrect treatment, or from a chain of events resulting from any of the above.
4.5. Indirect obstetric deaths
Indirect obstetric deaths are those resulting from previous existing disease or disease that developed during pregnancy and that was not due to direct obstetric causes, but which was aggravated by physiologic effects of pregnancy.
