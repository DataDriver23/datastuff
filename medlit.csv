A classification of diseases may be defined as a system of categories to which morbid entities are assigned according to established criteria. There are many possible axes of classification and the one selected will depend upon the use to be made of the statistics to be compiled. A statistical classification of diseases must encompass the entire range of morbid conditions within a manageable number of categories.The 10th revision of the International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems is the latest in a series that was formalized in 1893 as the Bertillon classification or International list of causes of death. A complete review of the historical background to the classification is given in V olume 2. While the title has been amended to make clearer the content and purpose and to reflect the progressive extension of the scope of the classification beyond diseases and injuries, the familiar abbreviation ‘ICD’ has been retained. In the updated classification, conditions have been grouped in a way that was felt to be most suitable for general epidemiological purposes and the evaluation of health care.Work on the 10th revision of the ICD started in September 1983 when a Preparatory Meeting on ICD-10 was convened in Geneva. The programme of work was guided by regular meetings of heads of WHO collaborating centres for classification of diseases. Policy guidance was provided by a number of special meetings, including those of the expert committee on the International classification of diseases – 10th revision, held in 1984 and 1987.In addition to the technical contributions provided by many specialist groups and individual experts, a large number of comments and suggestions were received from WHO Member States and regional offices as a result of the global circulation of draft proposals for revision in 1984 and 1986. From the comments received, it was clear that many users wished the ICD to encompass types of data other than the ‘diagnostic information’ (in the broadest sense of the term) that it has always covered. In order to accommodate the perceived needs of these users, the concept arose of a ‘family’ of classifications centred on the traditional ICD with its familiar form and structure. The ICD itself would thus meet the requirement for diagnostic information for general purposes, while a variety of other classifications would be used in conjunction with it and would deal either with different approaches to the same information or with different information (notably medical and surgical procedures and disablement).Following suggestions at the time of development of the ninth revision of the classification that a different basic structure might better serve the needs of the many and varied users, several alternative models were evaluated. It became clear, however, that the traditional single-variable-axis design of 1
Vol1_B&W.indb   1 15/09/15   12:09",4
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESthe classification, and other aspects of its structure that gave emphasis to conditions that were frequent, costly or otherwise of public health importance, had withstood the test of time and that many users would be unhappy with any of the models that had been proposed as a possible replacement.Consequently, as study of the 10th revision will show, the traditional ICD structure has been retained but an alphanumeric coding scheme replaces the previous numeric one. This provides a larger coding frame and leaves room for future revision without disruption of the numbering system, as has occurred at previous revisions.In order to make optimum use of the available space, certain disorders of the immune mechanism are included with diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs (Chapter III). New chapters have been created for diseases of the eye and adnexa, and diseases of the ear and mastoid process. The former supplementary classifications of external causes and of factors influencing health status and contact with health services now form part of the main classification.The dagger and asterisk system of dual classification for certain diagnostic statements, introduced in the ninth revision, has been retained and extended, with the asterisk axis being contained in homogeneous categories at the three-character level.
Content of the three volumes of ICD-10
The presentation of the classification has been changed and there are now three volumes:Volume 1. Tabular list. This contains the Report of the International Conference for the Tenth Revision, the classification itself at the three- and four-character levels, the classification of the morphology of neoplasms, special tabulation lists for mortality and morbidity, definitions, and the nomenclature regulations.Volume 2. Instruction manual. This brings together the notes on certification and classification formerly included in V olume 1, with a good deal of new background and instructional matter and guidance on the use of V olume 1, on tabulations, and on planning for the use of the ICD, which was seen as lacking in earlier revisions. It also includes the historical material formerly presented in the introduction to V olume 1.Volume 3. Alphabetical index. This presents the index itself with an introduction and expanded instructions on its use.* * *The classification was approved by the International Conference for the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases in 1989 and adopted by 2

The periodic revision of the ICD has, since the sixth revision in 1948, been coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO). As the use of the classification has increased, so, understandably, has the desire among its users to contribute to the revision process. The 10th revision is the product of a vast amount of international activity, cooperation and compromise, and WHO acknowledges with gratitude the contributions of the international and national specialist groups and individuals in numerous many countries.WHO gratefully acknowledges the important technical contribution of the WHO Collaborating Centre for the Family of International Classifications which is located at the Deutsches Institut für Medizinische Dokumentation und Information (DIMDI) in Cologne, Germany, and, in particular, that of the Head of the Centre Michael Schopen, in the updating of the texts and the preparation of the electronic files that were used for this version of ICD-10.

Thirteen WHO Collaborating Centres for the Family of International Classifications have been established to assist countries with problems encountered in the development and use of health-related classifications and, in particular, in the use of the ICD.It is important that countries bring to the attention of the respective centre any significant problems they might encounter in the use of the ICD, and especially when a new disease for which the ICD does not provide a suitable classification is encountered frequently. Until now, the ICD has not been updated between revisions but for ICD-10, through the centres, a mechanism has been introduced to provide suitable codes for new diseases where necessary.In addition to the official WHO collaborating centres, there are a number of national reference centres and individual users should first consult these, or their appropriate national office, when they encounter problems.There are three centres for English-language users.

Dr Jardel spoke of the extensive consultations and preparatory work that had gone into the revision proposals and had necessitated a longer than usual interval between revisions. He noted that the 10th revision would have a new title, International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems, to emphasize its statistical purpose and reflect the widening of its scope. The convenient abbreviation ICD would, however, be retained. He also mentioned the new alphanumeric coding scheme, which had made it possible to provide a better balance between the content of the chapters and to leave room for future additions and changes, as well as the intention to produce an ICD manual of three-character categories with an alphabetical index for use where the more complex, detailed four-character version would be inappropriate.The Conference elected the following officers:Dr RHC Wells, Australia (Chairman)  Dr H Bay-Nielsen, Denmark (Vice-Chairman)  Dr R Braun, German Democratic Republic (Vice-Chairman)  Mr RA Israel, United States of America (Vice-Chairman)  Dr  R Laurenti, Brazil (Vice-Chairman) Dr P Maguin, France (Rapporteur)  Ms E Taylor, Canada (Rapporteur).The secretariat of the conference was as follows:Dr JP Jardel, Assistant Director-General, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland  Dr HR Hapsara, Director, Division of Epidemiological Surveillance and Health Situation and Trend Assessment, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland  Dr JC Alary, Chief Medical Officer, Development of Epidemiological and Health Statistical Services, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland  Dr GR Brämer, Medical Officer, Development of Epidemiological and Health Statistical Services, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland (Secretary)  Mr A L’Hours, Technical Officer, Development of Epidemiological and Health Statistical Services, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland Professor W Jänisch, German Democratic Republic (Temporary Adviser)  Mr T Kruse, Denmark (Temporary Adviser)  Dr K Kupka, France (Temporary Adviser)  Dr J Leowski, Poland (Temporary Adviser)  REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE

1. History and development of uses of the 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
The conference was reminded of the impressive history of a statistical classification that dated back to the eighteenth century. While early revisions of the classification had been concerned only with causes of death, its scope had been extended at the sixth revision in 1948 to include non-fatal diseases. This extension had continued through the ninth revision, with certain innovations being made to meet the statistical needs of widely differing organizations. In addition, at the International Conference for the ninth revision (Geneva, 1975) (1), recommendations had been made and approved for the publication, for trial purposes, of supplementary classifications of procedures in medicine and of impairments, disabilities and handicaps.
2. Review of activities in the preparation of 
proposals for the Tenth Revision of the ICD
The proposals before the conference were the product of a vast amount of activity at WHO headquarters and around the world. The programme of work had been guided by regular meetings of the heads of WHO Collaborating Centres for Classification of Diseases. Policy guidance had been provided by a number of special meetings and by the Expert Committee on the International Classification of Diseases - Tenth Revision, which met in 1984 (2) and 1987 (3) to make decisions on the direction the work should take and the form of the final proposals.Extensive preparatory activity had been devoted to a radical review of the suitability of the structure of the ICD, essentially a statistical classification of diseases and other health problems, to serve a wide variety of needs for mortality and health-care data. Ways of stabilizing the coding system to minimize disruption at successive revisions had been investigated, as had the possibility of providing a better balance between the content of the different chapters of the ICD.14
Vol1_B&W.indb   14 15/09/15   12:09",17
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE
Even with a new structure, it was plain that one classification could not cope with the extremes of the requirements. The concept of a ‘family’ of classifications had therefore been developed, with the main ICD as the core, covering the centre ground of needs for traditional mortality and morbidity statistics, while needs for more detailed, less detailed or different classifications and associated matters would be dealt with by other members of the family.Several alternative models for the structure of the ICD had been investigated by the collaborating centres, but it had been found that each had unsatisfactory features and none had sufficient advantages over the existing structure to justify replacing it. Special meetings held to evaluate the ninth revision had confirmed that, although some potential users found the existing structure of the ICD unsuitable, there was a large body of satisfied users who considered it had many inherent strengths, whatever its apparent inconsistencies, and wished it to continue in its existing form.Various schemes involving alphanumeric notation had been examined, with a view to producing a coding frame that would give a better balance to the chapters and allow sufficient space for future additions and changes without disrupting the codes.Decisions made on these matters had paved the way for the preparation of successive drafts of chapter proposals for the 10th revision. These had twice been circulated to Member States for comment, as well as being reviewed by other interested bodies, meetings of centre heads, and the expert committee. A large number of international professional specialist associations, individual specialists and experts, other WHO headquarters units and regional offices had given advice and guidance to the WHO unit responsible for the ICD, and to the collaborating centres, on the preparation of the proposals and the associated material placed before the conference. WHO gratefully acknowledged this assistance.
3. General characteristics and content of the 
proposed 10th revision of the ICD
The main innovation in the proposals for the 10th revision was the use of an alphanumeric coding scheme of one letter followed by three numbers at the four-character level. This had the effect of more than doubling the size of the coding frame in comparison with the ninth revision and enabled the vast majority of chapters to be assigned a unique letter or group of letters, each capable of providing 100 three-character categories. Of the 26 available letters, 25 had been used, the letter U being left vacant for future additions and changes and for possible interim classifications to solve difficulties arising at the national and international level between revisions.15
Vol1_B&W.indb   15 15/09/15   12:09",18
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESAs a matter of policy, some three-character categories had been left vacant for future expansion and revision, with the number varying according to the chapters: those with a primarily anatomical axis of classification had fewer vacant categories, as it was considered that future changes in their content would be more limited in nature.The ninth revision contained 17 chapters plus two supplementary classifications: the Supplementary Classification of External Causes of Injury and Poisoning (the E code) and the Supplementary Classification of Factors Influencing Health Status and Contact with Health Services (the V code). As recommended by the Preparatory Meeting on the Tenth Revision (Geneva, 1983) (4) and endorsed by subsequent meetings, these two chapters were no longer considered to be supplementary but were included as a part of the core classification.The order of entry of chapters in the proposals for the 10th revision had originally been the same as in the ninth revision; however, to make effective use of the available space, disorders of the immune mechanism were later included with diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs, whereas in the ninth revision they had been included with endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases. The new chapter on ‘Diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism’ now followed the ‘Neoplasms’ chapter, with which it shared the letter D.During the elaboration of early drafts of the chapter on ‘Diseases of the nervous system and sense organs’, it had soon become clear that it would not be possible to accommodate all the required detail under one letter in 100 three-character categories. It had been decided, therefore, to create three separate chapters - ‘Diseases of the nervous system’ having the letter G, and the two chapters on ‘Diseases of the eye and adnexa’ and on ‘Diseases of the ear and mastoid process’ sharing the letter H.Also, the chapters on ‘Diseases of the genitourinary system’, on ‘Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium’, on ‘Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period’, and on ‘Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities’ had been brought together as contiguous chapters XIV to XVII.With the inclusion of the former supplementary classifications as part of the core classification and the creation of two new chapters, the total number of chapters in the proposal for the 10th revision had become 21. The titles of some chapters had been amended to give a better indication of their content.Where radical changes to the ICD had been proposed, field-testing had been appropriate. This had been the case for the following chapters:16
Vol1_B&W.indb   16 15/09/15   12:09",19
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCEV . Mental and behavioural disorders XIX. Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes XX. External causes of morbidity and mortalityChapter II, ‘Neoplasms’, had also been subject to some field-testing, although the changes in its content had been of a minor nature.Some new features of the proposals for the 10th revision were as follows:
• The exclusion notes at the beginning of each chapter had been expanded 
to explain the relative hierarchy of chapters, and to make it clear that the ‘special group’ chapters had priority of assignment over the organ or system chapters and that, among the special group chapters, those on ‘Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium‘ and on ‘Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period’ had priority over the others.
• Also, at the beginning of each chapter an overview was given of the blocks 
of three-character categories and, where relevant, the asterisk categories; this had been done to clarify the structure of the chapters and to facilitate the use of the asterisk categories.
• The notes in the tabular list applied to all uses of the classification; if a note 
was appropriate only to morbidity or only to mortality, it was included in the special notes accompanying either the morbidity coding rules or the mortality coding rules.
• The ninth revision had identified a certain number of conditions as being 
drug-induced; this approach had been continued in drawing up the proposals for the 10th revision, and many such conditions were now separately identified.An important innovation was the creation, towards the end of certain chapters, of categories for postprocedural disorders. These identified important conditions that constituted a medical care problem in their own right and included such examples as endocrine and metabolic diseases following ablation of an organ and other specific conditions such as postgastrectomy dumping syndrome. Postprocedural conditions that were not specific to a particular body system, including immediate complications such as air embolism and postoperative shock, continued to be classified in the chapter on ‘Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes’.Another change was that in the ninth revision, the four-digit titles had often had to be read in conjunction with the three-digit titles, to ascertain the full meaning and intent of the subcategory, whereas in the draft presented to the conference the titles were almost invariably complete and could stand alone.The dual classification scheme for etiology and manifestation, known as the dagger and asterisk system, introduced in the ninth revision, had been the 17
Vol1_B&W.indb   17 15/09/15   12:09",20
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESsubject of a certain amount of criticism. This related mainly to the fact that the classification frequently contained a mixture of manifestation and other information at the three- and four-digit levels, with the same diagnostic labels sometimes appearing under both axes. Also, many considered the system to be insufficiently comprehensive. To overcome these problems, in the draft for the 10th revision, the asterisk information was contained in 82 homogeneous three-character categories for optional use. This approach enabled those diagnostic statements containing information about both a generalized underlying disease process and a manifestation or complication in a particular organ or site to receive two codes, allowing retrieval or tabulation according to either axis.These characteristics of the proposed 10th revision were accepted by the conference.Each of the chapters was introduced to the conference, with a presentation on changes introduced since the ninth revision and some background information about certain innovations. Some issues related to changes in chapter structure and content were discussed by the conference and agreement reached on follow-up and modification by the secretariat.
4. Standards and definitions related to maternal 
and child health
The conference considered with interest the recommended definitions, standards and reporting requirements for the 10th  revision with regard to maternal mortality and to fetal, perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality. These recommendations were the outcome of a series of special meetings and consultations and were directed towards improving the comparability of data.The conference agreed that it was desirable to retain the definitions of live birth and fetal death as they appeared in the ninth revision.After some discussion, the conference set up a working party on the subject of maternal mortality and, on the basis of its recommendations, also agreed to retain the definition of maternal death as it appeared in the ninth revision.In order to improve the quality of maternal mortality data and provide alternative methods of collecting data on deaths during pregnancy or related to it, as well as to encourage the recording of deaths from obstetric causes occurring more than 42 days following termination of pregnancy, two additional definitions, for ‘pregnancy-related deaths’ and ‘late maternal deaths’, were formulated by the working party. [These are included in the section Definitions, p.1069].18

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCEThe conferenceRECOMMENDED that countries consider the inclusion on death certificates of questions regarding current pregnancy and pregnancy within one year preceding death.The conference agreed that, since the number of live births was more universally available than the number of total births (live births plus fetal deaths), it should be used as the denominator in the ratios related to maternal mortality [as contained in V olume 2].With respect to perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality, it was strongly advised that published rates based on birth cohorts should be so identified and differentiated.The conference confirmed the practice of expressing age in completed units of time and thus designating the first day of life as day zero.The conferenceRECOMMENDED the inclusion, in the manual of the 10th revision of the ICD, of definitions, standards and reporting requirements related to maternal mortality and to fetal, perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality .
5. Coding and selection rules and tabulation lists
5.1. Coding and selection rules for mortality
The conference was informed about a process for review of the selection and modification rules for underlying cause of death and the associated notes, as they appeared in the ninth revision, which had resulted in several recommended changes in the rules and extensive changes to the notes.The conferenceRECOMMENDED that the rules for selection of cause of death for primary mortality tabulation, as they appear in the ninth revision, be replaced in the 10th revision [by those contained in V olume 2].The conference was further informed that additional notes for use in underlying cause coding and the interpretation of entries of causes of death had been drafted and were being reviewed. As these notes were intended to improve consistency in coding, the conference agreed that they would also be incorporated in the 10th revision.The conference noted the continued use of multiple-condition coding and analysis in relation to causes of death. It expressed encouragement for such activities, but did not recommend that the 10th revision should contain any particular rules or methods of analysis to be followed.19
Vol1_B&W.indb   19 15/09/15   12:09",22
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESIn considering the international form of medical certificate of cause of death, the expert committee had recognized that the situation of an aging population with a greater proportion of deaths involving multiple disease processes, and the effects of associated therapeutic interventions, tended to increase the number of possible statements between the underlying cause and the direct cause of death: this meant that an increasing number of conditions were being entered on death certificates in many countries. This led the committee to recommend the inclusion of an additional line (d) in Part I of the certificate.The conference thereforeRECOMMENDED that, where a need has been identified, countries consider the possibility of including an additional line (d) in Part I of the medical certificate of cause of death.
5.2. Coding and selection rules for morbidity
For the first time, the ninth revision contained guidance on recording and coding for morbidity and specifically for the selection of a single condition for presentation of morbidity statistics. Experience gained in the use of the definitions and rules in the ninth revision had proved their usefulness and generated requests for their clarification, for further elaboration regarding the recording of diagnostic information by health-care practitioners, and for more guidance on dealing with specific problem situations.The conference endorsed the recommendations of the 1975 Revision Conference about the condition to be selected for single-condition analysis of episodes of health care, and its view that, where practicable, multiple-condition coding and analysis should be undertaken to supplement routine statistics. It stressed that the 10th revision should make it clear that much of the guidance was applicable only when the tabulation of a ‘main condition’ for an episode was appropriate and when the concept of an ‘episode’ per se was relevant to the way in which data collection was organized.The conference accordinglyRECOMMENDED that additional guidance on the recording and coding of morbidity should be included in the 10th  Revision, and that the definitions of “main condition” and “other conditions” should be incorporated, together with the modified rules for dealing with obviously incorrectly reported “main condition”. [These are included in V olume 2.]The conference alsoRECOMMENDED that where the “main condition” is subject to the dual classification system provided in the ICD, both the dagger and asterisk codes should be recorded, to permit alternative tabulation by either.20

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCEThe conference agreed that extensive notes and examples should be added to provide further assistance.
5.3. Lists for tabulation of mortality and morbidity
The conference was informed about difficulties that had arisen in the use of the Basic tabulation list based on the ninth revision and about the activities that had been undertaken, particularly by WHO, to develop new lists for the tabulation and publication of mortality data. In this process it had become apparent that, in 
many countries, mortality up to the age of 5  years was a more robust indicator 
than infant mortality, and that it would therefore be preferable to have a list that 
included infant deaths and deaths of children up to the age of 5  years, rather than 
a list for infants only.Two versions of the general mortality list and of the infant and child mortality list had been prepared for consideration by the conference, with the second version including chapter titles and residual items for chapters as necessary.As some concerns were expressed regarding the mortality lists as presented, a small working party was convened to consider the possible inclusion of some additional items. The report of the working party was accepted by the Conference and is reflected in the mortality lists (see Special tabulation list for mortality and morbidity, p. 1043).On the topic of lists for the tabulation of morbidity, the conference reviewed both a proposed tabulation list and a model publication list based on chapter titles, with selected items included as examples under each title. Considerable concern was expressed about the applicability of such lists to all morbidity in the broadest sense. There was general agreement that the lists as presented were probably more suited to inpatient morbidity, and it was felt that further efforts should be made to develop lists suitable for other morbidity applications, and also that both mortality and morbidity tabulation lists should be accompanied in the 10th revision by appropriate explanations and instructions on their use.In light of the concerns raised in the conference and the conclusions of the working party, the conference agreed that the tabulation and publication lists should appear in the 10th revision, while an effort should be made to establish clearer, more descriptive titles for these lists. It was also agreed that, to facilitate the alternative tabulation of asterisk categories, a second version of the morbidity tabulation list should be developed, which included the asterisk categories.

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES6. Family of classifications
6.1. Concept of the family of classifications
During the preparation of the ninth revision it had already been realized that the ICD alone could not cover all the information required and that only a ‘family’ of disease and health-related classifications would meet the different requirements in public health. Since the late 1970s, therefore, various possible solutions had been envisaged, one of which called for a core classification (ICD) with a series of modules, some hierarchically related and others of a supplementary nature.After studies and discussions in cooperation with the various collaborating centres, a concept of a family of classifications had been elaborated and subsequently revised by the expert committee in 1987, which had recommended the scheme shown below.

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCEThe conferenceRECOMMENDED that the concept of the family of disease and health-related classifications should be followed up by WHO.In order to maintain the integrity of the ICD itself and this family concept, the conferenceRECOMMENDED that, in the interests of international comparability, no changes should be made to the content (as indicated by the titles) of the three-character categories and four-character sub-categories of the 10th revision in the preparation of translations or adaptations, except as authorized by WHO. The Secretariat of WHO is responsible for the ICD and acts as central clearing-house for any publication (except national statistical publications) or translation to be derived from it. WHO should be promptly notified about the intention to produce translations and adaptations or other ICD-related classifications.The conference viewed with interest a presentation of the use and linkage of different members of the ICD family in the medicosocial and multidimensional assessment of the elderly in relation not only to health but also to activities of daily living as well as the social and physical environment. It was demonstrated that effective information could be obtained through use of the ICD and the International classification of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps  (ICIDH), and especially through use of the codes from the proposed Chapter XXI of the 10th revision.
6.2. Specialty-based adaptations
The conference was informed about plans for the development of adaptations of the 10th revision in the mental health programme area. Clinical guidelines would accompany a version intended for use by clinicians working in the field of psychiatry; research criteria would be proposed for use in investigations of mental health problems; and multi-axial presentations for use in dealing with childhood disorders and for the classification of adult problems would be developed, as well as a version for use by general practitioners. Compilations of ICD codes relevant to psychiatry and to neurology would also be produced, along the lines of previous publications on this subject.The Conference also heard about the methods used to ensure that the basic structure and function of the ICD were preserved in the initial development of the application for medical specialists in dentistry and stomatology (ICD-DA) and was informed that a new revision of the ICD-DA linked to the 10th revision was in the final stages of preparation.A presentation was given on the International classification of diseases for oncology (ICD-O), second edition, a multi-axial classification including both 23

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESthe topography and morphology of neoplasms. The morphology codes of the ICD-O, which had evolved over a long period of time, had been revised and extensively field-tested. The topography codes of the second edition would be based on categories C00–C80 in the 10th revision and publication would, therefore, await World Health Assembly approval of the 10th revision.There was agreement on the value of an adaptation in the area of general medical practice and the conference was informed about the willingness of groups working in this area to collaborate with WHO. In respect of other specialty-based adaptations, which were likely to become more numerous, the recommended role of WHO as a clearing-house was considered to be extremely important.
6.3. Information support to primary health care
In accordance with the recommendations of the 1975 Revision Conference, a working group had been convened by the WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia in Delhi in 1976. It had drawn up a detailed list of symptom associations and, from this, two short lists were derived, one for causes of death and one for reasons for contact with health services. Field trials of this system had been carried out in countries of the region and the results used to revise the list of symptom associations and the reporting forms. This revised version had been published by WHO in 1978, in the booklet Lay reporting of health information (6).The Global strategy for health for all by the year 2000 (7) , launched in 1978, had raised a number of challenges for the development of information systems in Member States. At the International Conference on Health Statistics for the Year 2000 (Bellagio, Italy, 1982) (8), the integration of ‘lay reporting’ information with other information generated and used for health management purposes had been identified as a major problem inhibiting the wider implementation of lay reporting schemes. The Consultation on primary care classifications (Geneva, 1985) (9) had stressed the need for an approach that could unify information support, health service management and community services through information based on lay reporting in the expanded sense of community-based information.The conference was informed about the experience of countries in developing and applying community-based health information that covered health problems and needs, related risk factors and resources. It supported the concept of developing non-conventional methods at the community level as a method of filling information gaps in individual countries and strengthening their information systems. It was stressed that, for both developed and developing countries, such methods or systems should be developed locally and that, because of factors such as morbidity patterns, as well as language and cultural variations, transfer to other areas or countries should not be attempted.24

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE6.4. Impairments, disabilities and handicaps
The International classification of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps  (ICIDH) (5) had been published by WHO in English in 1980 for trial purposes, in accordance with the recommendations of the 1975 revision conference and resolution WHA29.35 (10) of the 1976 World Health Assembly. Since that time, research and development on the classification had followed a number of paths.The major definitions of the three elements – impairment, disability and handicap – had undoubtedly been instrumental in changing attitudes to disablement. The definition of ‘impairment’, an area where there was considerable overlap with the terms included in the ICD, had been widely accepted. The definition of ‘disability’ broadly matched the field of action of rehabilitation professionals and groups, although there was felt to be a need for more attention in the associated code to the gradation of severity, which was often a predictor of handicap. There had also been increasing requests to revise the definition of ‘handicap’ in order to put more emphasis on the effect of interaction with the environment.The rapid evolution of ideas and practices in the management of disablement had ruled out the production of a revised ICIDH in time to be submitted to the conference. It was stated that the publication of a new version was unlikely before implementation of the 10th revision.
6.5. Procedures in medicine
The International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM) (11) had been published by WHO in 1978 for trial purposes, in accordance with the recommendations of the 1975 Revision Conference and resolution WHA29.35 (10) of the 1976 World Health Assembly. The classification had been adopted by a few countries and was used as a basis for national classifications of surgical operations by a number of other countries.The heads of WHO collaborating centres for classification of diseases had recognized that the process of drafting proposals, obtaining comments, redrafting and soliciting further comments, which WHO necessarily had to go through before finalization and publication, was inappropriate in such a rapidly advancing field as that of procedures. The centre heads had therefore recommended that there should be no revision of the ICPM in conjunction with the 10th revision of ICD.In 1987 the expert committee had asked that WHO consider updating for the 10th revision at least the outline of Chapter 5, ‘Surgical procedures’, of the trial ICPM. In response to this request and the needs expressed by a number of countries, an attempt had been made by the Secretariat to prepare a tabulation list for procedures.25
Vol1_B&W.indb   25 15/09/15   12:09",28
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESThis list had been presented to the centre heads at their 1989 meeting and it had been agreed that it could serve as a guide for national presentation or publication of statistics on surgical procedures and could also facilitate intercountry comparisons. The aim of the list was to identify procedures and groups of procedures and define them as a basis for the development of national classifications, thereby improving the comparability of such classifications.The conference agreed that such a list was of value and that work should continue on its development, even though any publication would follow the implementation of the 10th revision.
6.6. International Nomenclature of Diseases
Since 1970, the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) had been involved in the preparation of an International Nomenclature of Diseases (IND), which would serve as a complement to the ICD.The main purpose of the IND was to provide a single recommended name for every morbid entity. The main criteria for selection of that name were that it should be specific, unambiguous, as self-descriptive and simple as possible, and based on cause wherever feasible. Each disease or syndrome for which a name was recommended was defined as unambiguously and as briefly as possible. A list of synonyms was appended to each definition.At the time of the conference, volumes had been published on diseases of the lower respiratory tract, infectious diseases (viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases and mycoses) and cardiac and vascular diseases, and work was under way on volumes for the digestive system, female genital system, urinary and male genital system, metabolic and endocrine diseases, blood and blood-forming organs, immunological system, musculoskeletal system and nervous system. Subjects proposed for future volumes included psychiatric diseases, as well as diseases of the skin, ear, nose and throat, and eye and adnexa.The conference recognized that an authoritative, up-to-date and international nomenclature of diseases was important in developing the ICD and improving the comparability of health information. The conference thereforeRECOMMENDED that WHO and CIOMS be encouraged to explore cost-efficient ways to achieve the timely completion and maintenance of such a nomenclature.
7. Implementation of the 10th revision of the ICD
The conference was informed of WHO’s intention to publish the detailed four-character version of the 10th revision in three volumes: one containing the tabular list, a second containing all related definitions, standards, rules and instructions, and a third containing the alphabetical index.26
Vol1_B&W.indb   26 15/09/15   12:09",29
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCEThe conference was further informed that a three-character version of the 10th revision would be published as a single volume which would contain, in the tabular list, all inclusion and exclusion notes. It would also contain all related definitions, standards, rules and instructions and a shortened alphabetical index.Member States intending to produce national language versions of the 10th revision should notify WHO of their intentions. Copies of the drafts of the ICD at the three- and four-character levels would be made available from WHO both in printed form and on electronic media.With respect to the physical appearance of the pages and type formats for both the tabular list and the alphabetical index, the conference was assured that recommendations from the centre heads and complaints from coders would be considered, and every attempt made to improve those aspects as compared with the ninth revision.As with the ninth revision, it was intended to develop materials for the reorientation of trained coders, with the help of the collaborating centres. The actual training courses would be the responsibility of the WHO regional offices and individual countries. They would be carried out from late 1991 to the end of 1992, to finish before the implementation of the 10th revision.Materials for the basic training of new users of the ICD would also be developed by WHO; it was not, however, planned to begin courses before 1993.As noted above, WHO would be prepared to provide the 10th revision (both the tabular list and the alphabetical index) on electronic media. In future, with the assistance of the collaborating centres, other software might also be made available. A key for conversion from the ninth to the 10th revision, and the reverse, should be available before the implementation of the 10th  revision.As the development activities that had been endorsed by the expert committee were on schedule, the conferenceRECOMMENDED that the 10th revision of the International classification of diseases should come into effect as from 1 January 1993.
8. Future revision of the ICD
The conference discussed the difficulties experienced during the extended period of use of the ninth revision, related to the emergence of new diseases and the lack of an updating mechanism to accommodate them.Various suggestions for mechanisms to overcome these difficulties and avoid similar problems with respect to the 10th revision were discussed. There was a clear feeling that there was a need for ongoing information exchange to standardize the use of the 10th revision between countries, but that any changes introduced during its ‘lifetime’ should be considered very carefully in relation 27
Vol1_B&W.indb   27 15/09/15   12:09",30
9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESto their impact on analyses and trends. There was discussion on the type of forum in which such changes and the potential for use of the vacant letter ‘U’ in new or temporary code assignments could be discussed. It was agreed that it would not be feasible to hold revision conferences more frequently than every 10 years.On the basis of the needs expressed, and the fact that it would be inappropriate to attempt to determine or define the exact process to be used, the conferenceRECOMMENDED that the next International revision conference should take place in ten years’ time, and that WHO should endorse the concept of an updating process between revisions and give consideration as to how an effective updating mechanism could be put in place.
9. Adoption of the 10th Revision of the ICD
The conference made the following recommendation:Having considered the proposals prepared by the organization on the basis of the recommendations of the expert committee on the International classification of diseases – 10th  revision,Recognizing the need for a few further minor modifications to reflect the comments on points of detail submitted by Member States during the conference,RECOMMENDED that the proposed revised chapters, with their three-character categories and four-character subcategories and the Short tabulation lists for morbidity and mortality, constitute the 10th revision of the International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems.

Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected by dengue viruses. It is one disease entity with different clinical presentations and often with unpredictable clinical evolution and outcome. Most patients recover following a self-limiting non-severe clinical course like nausea, vomiting, rash, aches and pains, but a small proportion progress to severe disease, mostly characterized by plasma leakage with or without haemorrhage, although severe haemorrhages or severe organ impairment can occur, with or without dengue shock.

Notes
1.	Primary, 	ill-defined, 	secondary 	and	unspecified 	sites	of	
malignant 	neoplasms
Categories 	C76−C80	include	malignant 	neoplasms 	for	which	there	is	no	clear	indication	of	the	
original site of the cancer, or the cancer is stated to be ‘disseminated’, ‘scattered’ or ‘spread’ without mention of the primary site. In both cases the primary site is considered to be unknown.
2.	Functional 	activity
All	neoplasms 	are	classified	in	this	chapter,	whether	they	are	functionally 	active	or	
not. An additional code from Chapter IV may be used, if desired, to identify functional activity associated with any neoplasm. For example, catecholamine-producing malignant phaeochromocytoma of adrenal gland should be coded to C74 with additional code E27.5; basophil adenoma of pituitary gland with Cushing syndrome should be coded to D35.2 with additional code E24.0.CHAPTER II

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES3.	Morphology
There are a number of major morphological (histological) groups of malignant neoplasms: carcinomas including squamous (cell) and adenocarcinomas; sarcomas; other soft tissue tumours including mesotheliomas; lymphomas (Hodgkin and non-
Hodgkin); 	leukaemia; 	other	specified	and	site-specific 	types;	and	unspecified 	cancers.	
Cancer is a generic term and may be used for any of the above groups, although it is rarely applied to the malignant neoplasms of lymphatic, haematopoietic and related tissue. ‘Carcinoma’ is sometimes used incorrectly as a synonym for ‘cancer’. 
In	Chapter	II,	neoplasms 	are	classified	predominantly 	by	site	within	broad	groupings 	
for behaviour. In a few exceptional cases, morphology is indicated in the category and subcategory titles.For those wishing to identify the histological type of neoplasm, the list of morphology codes of ICD-O is available for separate download online.  The list formerly included in ICD-10 was outdated because it was derived from the second edition of the International classification of diseases for oncology
	(ICD-O).	ICD-O	is	a	dual-axis	classification 	
providing independent coding systems for topography and morphology. Morphology 
codes	have	six	digits:	the	first	four	digits	identify	the	histological 	type;	the	fifth	digit	
is the behaviour code (malignant primary, malignant secondary (metastatic), in situ, benign, uncertain whether malignant or benign); and the sixth digit is a grading code (differentiation) for solid tumours, and is also used as a special code for lymphomas and leukaemias.The ICD-O lists can be downloaded from the classification website of WHO (www.who.int/classifications).
4.	Use	of	subcategories 	in	Chapter	II
Attention is drawn to the special use of subcategory .8 in this chapter [see note 5]. Where it has been necessary to provide subcategories for ‘other’, these have generally been designated as subcategory .7.
5.	Malignant 	neoplasms 	overlapping 	site	boundaries 	and	the	
use	of	subcategory 	.8	(overlapping 	lesion)
Categories 	C00−C75 	classify	primary	malignant 	neoplasms 	according 	to	their	point	
of origin. Many three-character categories are further divided into named parts or subcategories of the organ in question. A neoplasm that overlaps two or more contiguous sites within a three-character category, and whose point of origin cannot be determined, 
should	be	classified	to	the	subcategory 	.8	(‘overlapping 	lesion’),	unless	the	combination 	
is	specifically 	indexed	elsewhere. 	For	example,	carcinoma 	of	oesophagus 	and	stomach	
is	specifically 	indexed	to	C16.0	(cardia),	while	carcinoma 	of	the	tip	and	ventral	surface	
of the tongue should be assigned to C02.8. On the other hand, carcinoma of the tip of the tongue extending to involve the ventral surface should be coded to C02.1, as the point of origin, the tip, is known. ‘Overlapping’ implies that the sites involved are contiguous (next to each other). Numerically consecutive subcategories are frequently anatomically contiguous, but this is not invariably so (e.g. bladder C67.-) and the coder may need to consult anatomical texts to determine the topographical relationships.

9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf,"167
CHAPTER II NEOPLASMSSometimes a neoplasm overlaps the boundaries of three-character categories within certain systems. To take care of this, the following subcategories have been designated:
C02.8  Overlapping lesion of tongue
C08.8  Overlapping lesion of major salivary glands
C14.8  Overlapping lesion of lip, oral cavity and pharynx
C21.8  Overlapping lesion of rectum, anus and anal canal
C24.8  Overlapping lesion of biliary tract
C26.8  Overlapping lesion of digestive system
C39.8  Overlapping lesion of respiratory and intrathoracic organs
C41.8  Overlapping lesion of bone and articular cartilage
C49.8  Overlapping lesion of connective and soft tissue
C57.8  Overlapping lesion of female genital organs
C63.8  Overlapping lesion of male genital organs
C68.8  Overlapping lesion of urinary organs
C72.8  Overlapping lesion of central nervous system
An example of this is a carcinoma of the stomach and small intestine, which should be coded to C26.8 (Overlapping lesion of digestive system).
6.	Malignant 	neoplasms 	of	ectopic	tissue
Malignant neoplasms of ectopic tissue are to be coded to the site where they are found, e.g. ectopic pancreatic malignant neoplasms of ovary are coded to ovary (C56).
7.	Use	of	the	Alphabetical 	index	in	coding	neoplasms
In addition to site, morphology and behaviour must also be taken into consideration 
when	coding	neoplasms, 	and	reference	should	always	be	made	first	to	the	Alphabetical 	
index entry for the morphological description.The introductory pages of V olume 3 include general instructions about the correct use of 
the	Alphabetical 	index.	The	specific	instructions 	and	examples	pertaining 	to	neoplasms 	
should be consulted to ensure correct use of the categories and subcategories in Chapter II.
8.	Use	of	the	International classification of diseases for oncology
	(ICD-O)
For certain morphological types, Chapter II provides a rather restricted topographical 
classification, 	or	none	at	all.	The	topography 	codes	of	ICD-O	use	for	all	neoplasms 	
essentially the same three- and four-character categories that Chapter II uses for 
malignant 	neoplasms 	(C00−C77, 	C80),	thus	providing 	increased 	specificity 	of	site	for	
other neoplasms (malignant secondary (metastatic), benign, in situ and uncertain or unknown).It is therefore recommended that agencies interested in identifying both the site and morphology of tumours, e.g. cancer registries, cancer hospitals, pathology departments and other agencies specializing in cancer, use ICD-O.

In	situ	neoplasms  (D00–D09)
Note:  Many in situ neoplasms are regarded as being located within a continuum of 
morphological change between dysplasia and invasive cancer. For example, for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), three grades are recognized, the third of which (CIN III) includes both severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. This system of grading has been extended to other organs, such as vulva and vagina. Descriptions of grade III intraepithelial neoplasia, with or without mention of severe dysplasia, are assigned to this section; grades 
I	and	II	are	classified	as	dysplasia	of	the	organ	system	involved	and	should	
be coded to the relevant body system chapter.Incl.:

When	one	or	more	previous	measurements 	are	available, 	lack	of	weight	
gain	in	children,	or	evidence	of	weight	loss	in	children	or	adults,	is	usually	
indicative 	of	malnutrition. 	When	only	one	measurement 	is	available, 	the

or laboratory tests. In the exceptional circumstances that no measurement of 
weight	is	available, 	reliance	should	be	placed	on	clinical	evidence.
If	an	observed	weight	is	below	the	mean	value	of	the	reference	population,

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESOrganic, including symptomatic, mental disorders (F00–F09)
This	block	comprises 	a	range	of	mental	disorders	grouped	together	on	the	basis	of	their	
having	in	common	a	demonstrable 	etiology	in	cerebral	disease,	brain	injury,	or	other	
insult	leading	to	cerebral	dysfunction. 	The	dysfunction 	may	be	primary,	as	in	diseases,	
injuries,	and	insults	that	affect	the	brain	directly	and	selectively; 	or	secondary, 	as	in	
systemic	diseases	and	disorders	that	attack	the	brain	only	as	one	of	the	multiple	organs	
or	systems	of	the	body	that	are	involved.
Dementia 	(F00–F03) 	is	a	syndrome 	due	to	disease	of	the	brain,	usually	of	a	chronic	or	
progressive 	nature,	in	which	there	is	disturbance 	of	multiple	higher	cortical	functions, 	
including 	memory,	thinking,	orientation, 	comprehension, 	calculation, 	learning	capacity,	
language	and	judgement. 	Consciousness 	is	not	clouded.	The	impairments 	of	cognitive	
function	are	commonly 	accompanied, 	and	occasionally 	preceded, 	by	deterioration 	in	
emotional 	control,	social	behaviour 	or	motivation. 	This	syndrome 	occurs	in	Alzheimer 	
disease,	in	cerebrovascular 	disease,	and	in	other	conditions 	primarily	or	secondarily 	
affecting	the	brain.
Use	additional 	code,	if	desired,	to	identify	the	underlying 	disease.

disturbances 	in	level	of	consciousness, 	cognition, 	perception, 	affect	or	behaviour, 	or	
other	psycho-physiological 	functions	and	responses. 	The	disturbances 	are	directly	
related	to	the	acute	pharmacological 	effects	of	the	substance 	and	resolve	with	time,	
with	complete	recovery,	except	where	tissue	damage	or	other	complications 	have	
arisen.	Complications 	may	include	trauma,	inhalation 	of	vomitus,	delirium,	coma,	
convulsions, 	and	other	medical	complications. 	The	nature	of	these	complications 	
depends	on	the	pharmacological 	class	of	substance 	and	mode	of	administration.

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES.1  Harmful use
A	pattern	of	psychoactive 	substance 	use	that	is	causing	damage	to	health.	The	
damage	may	be	physical	(as	in	cases	of	hepatitis	from	the	self-administration 	of	
injected	psychoactive 	substances) 	or	mental	(e.g.	episodes	of	depressive 	disorder	
secondary 	to	heavy	consumption 	of	alcohol).
Psychoactive 	substance 	abuse
.2  Dependence syndrome
A	cluster	of	behavioural, 	cognitive	and	physiological 	phenomena 	that	develop	after	
repeated	substance 	use	and	that	typically	include	a	strong	desire	to	take	the	drug,	
difficulties 	in	controlling 	its	use,	persisting 	in	its	use	despite	harmful	consequences, 	
a	higher	priority	given	to	drug	use	than	to	other	activities	and	obligations, 	increased 	
tolerance, 	and	sometimes 	a	physical	withdrawal 	state.
The	dependence 	syndrome 	may	be	present	for	a	specific	psychoactive 	substance 	
(e.g.	tobacco,	alcohol	or	diazepam), 	for	a	class	of	substances 	(e.g.	opioid	drugs)	or	
for	a	wider	range	of	pharmacologically 	different	psychoactive 	substances.
Chronic	alcoholism
Dipsomania
Drug	addiction
.3  Withdrawal state
A	group	of	symptoms 	of	variable	clustering 	and	severity,	occurring	on	absolute	or	
relative	withdrawal 	of	a	psychoactive 	substance 	after	persistent	use	of	that	substance. 	
The	onset	and	course	of	the	withdrawal 	state	are	time-limited 	and	are	related	to	the	
type	of	psychoactive 	substance 	and	dose	being	used	immediately 	before	cessation	or	
reduction	of	use.	The	withdrawal 	state	may	be	complicated 	by	convulsions.
.4  Withdrawal state with delirium
A	condition 	where	the	withdrawal 	state	as	defined	in	the	common	fourth	character	
.3	is	complicated 	by	delirium	as	defined	in	F05.-.	Convulsions 	may	also	occur.	
When organic factors are also considered to play a role in the etiology, the condition 
should	be	classified	to	F05.8.
Delirium	tremens	(alcohol-induced)
.5  Psychotic disorder
A	cluster	of	psychotic 	phenomena 	that	occur	during	or	following 	psychoactive 	
substance 	use	but	that	are	not	explained 	on	the	basis	of	acute	intoxication 	alone	
and	do	not	form	part	of	a	withdrawal 	state.	The	disorder	is	characterized 	by	
hallucinations 	(typically 	auditory,	but	often	in	more	than	one	sensory	modality), 	
perceptual 	distortions, 	delusions 	(often	of	a	paranoid	or	persecutory 	nature),	
psychomotor 	disturbances 	(excitement 	or	stupor)	and	an	abnormal 	affect,	which	
may	range	from	intense	fear	to	ecstasy.	The	sensorium 	is	usually	clear	but	some	
degree	of	clouding	of	consciousness, 	though	not	severe	confusion, 	may	be	present.

This	block	brings	together	schizophrenia, 	as	the	most	important 	member	of	the	group,	
schizotypal 	disorder,	persistent 	delusional 	disorders, 	and	a	larger	group	of	acute	and	
transient	psychotic 	disorders. 	Schizoaffective 	disorders	have	been	retained	here	in	spite	
of	their	controversial 	nature.
  F20   Schizophrenia
The	schizophrenic 	disorders	are	characterized 	in	general	by	fundamental 	
and characteristic distortions of thinking and perception, and affects that are 
inappropriate 	or	blunted.	Clear	consciousness 	and	intellectual 	capacity	are	usually	
maintained, 	although	certain	cognitive	deficits	may	evolve	in	the	course	of	time.	
The	most	important 	psychopathological 	phenomena 	include	thought	echo;	thought	
insertion	or	withdrawal; 	thought	broadcasting; 	delusional 	perception 	and	delusions 	
of	control;	influence	or	passivity; 	hallucinatory 	voices	commenting 	or	discussing 	
the	patient	in	the	third	person;	thought	disorders; 	and	negative	symptoms.
The	course	of	schizophrenic 	disorders	can	be	either	continuous, 	or	episodic	with	
progressive 	or	stable	deficit,	or	there	can	be	one	or	more	episodes	with	complete	
or	incomplete 	remission. 	The	diagnosis 	of	schizophrenia 	should	not	be	made	
in	the	presence	of	extensive 	depressive 	or	manic	symptoms 	unless	it	is	clear	
that	schizophrenic 	symptoms 	antedate	the	affective	disturbance. 	Nor	should	
schizophrenia 	be	diagnosed 	in	the	presence	of	overt	brain	disease	or	during	states	
of	drug	intoxication 	or	withdrawal. 	Similar	disorders	developing 	in	the	presence	of	
epilepsy	or	other	brain	disease	should	be	classified	under	F06.2,	and	those	induced	
by	psychoactive 	substances 	under	F10–F19	with	common	fourth	character	.5.

F20.0  Paranoid schizophrenia
Paranoid	schizophrenia 	is	dominated 	by	relatively 	stable,	often	paranoid	delusions, 	
usually	accompanied 	by	hallucinations, 	particularly 	of	the	auditory	variety,	and	
perceptual 	disturbances. 	Disturbances 	of	affect,	volition	and	speech,	and	catatonic	
symptoms, 	are	either	absent	or	relatively 	inconspicuous.

hallucinations 	fleeting	and	fragmentary, 	behaviour 	irresponsible 	and	unpredictable, 	
and	mannerisms 	common.	The	mood	is	shallow	and	inappropriate, 	thought	is	
disorganized, 	and	speech	is	incoherent. 	There	is	a	tendency	to	social	isolation.	
Usually	the	prognosis 	is	poor	because	of	the	rapid	development 	of	‘negative’ 	
symptoms, 	particularly 	flattening 	of	affect	and	loss	of	volition.	Hebephrenia 	should	
normally	be	diagnosed 	only	in	adolescents 	or	young	adults.

INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASESF20.2  Catatonic schizophrenia
Catatonic 	schizophrenia 	is	dominated 	by	prominent 	psychomotor 	disturbances 	
that	may	alternate	between	extremes	such	as	hyperkinesis 	and	stupor,	or	automatic 	
obedience 	and	negativism. 	Constrained 	attitudes	and	postures	may	be	maintained 	
for	long	periods.	Episodes	of	violent	excitement 	may	be	a	striking	feature	of	the	
condition. 	The	catatonic	phenomena 	may	be	combined 	with	a	dream-like 	(oneiroid) 	
state	with	vivid	scenic	hallucinations.

F20.4  Post-schizophrenic depression
A	depressive 	episode,	which	may	be	prolonged, 	arising	in	the	aftermath 	of	
a	schizophrenic 	illness.	Some	schizophrenic 	symptoms, 	either	‘positive’ 	or	
‘negative’, 	must	still	be	present	but	they	no	longer	dominate	the	clinical	picture.	
These	depressive 	states	are	associated 	with	an	increased 	risk	of	suicide.	If	the	
patient	no	longer	has	any	schizophrenic 	symptoms, 	a	depressive 	episode	should	
be	diagnosed 	(F32.-).	If	schizophrenic 	symptoms 	are	still	florid	and	prominent, 	
the	diagnosis 	should	remain	that	of	the	appropriate 	schizophrenic 	subtype	(F20.0–
F20.3).
F20.5  Residual schizophrenia
A	chronic	stage	in	the	development 	of	a	schizophrenic 	illness	in	which	there	has	
been	a	clear	progression 	from	an	early	stage	to	a	later	stage	characterized 	by	long-	
term,	though	not	necessarily 	irreversible, 	‘negative’ 	symptoms, 	e.g.	psychomotor 	
slowing;	underactivity; 	blunting	of	affect;	passivity	and	lack	of	initiative; 	poverty	of	
quantity	or	content	of	speech;	poor	nonverbal 	communication 	by	facial	expression,

A	disorder	characterized 	by	the	development 	either	of	a	single	delusion	or	of	a	
set	of	related	delusions 	that	are	usually	persistent 	and	sometimes 	lifelong.	The	
content	of	the	delusion	or	delusions 	is	very	variable.	Clear	and	persistent 	auditory	
hallucinations 	(voices),	schizophrenic 	symptoms 	such	as	delusions 	of	control	and	
marked	blunting	of	affect,	and	definite	evidence	of	brain	disease	are	all	incompatible 	
with	this	diagnosis. 	However, 	the	presence	of	occasional 	or	transitory 	auditory	
hallucinations, 	particularly 	in	elderly	patients,	does	not	rule	out	this	diagnosis,

A	heterogeneous 	group	of	disorders	characterized 	by	the	acute	onset	of	psychotic 	
symptoms 	such	as	delusions, 	hallucinations 	and	perceptual 	disturbances, 	and	by	
the	severe	disruption 	of	ordinary	behaviour. 	Acute	onset	is	defined	as	a	crescendo 	
development 	of	a	clearly	abnormal 	clinical	picture	in	about	two	weeks	or	less.	
For	these	disorders, 	there	is	no	evidence	of	organic	causation. 	Perplexity 	and	
puzzlement 	are	often	present	but	disorientation 	for	time,	place	and	person	is	not	
persistent 	or	severe	enough	to	justify	a	diagnosis 	of	organically 	caused	delirium

few	weeks	or	even	days.	If	the	disorder	persists,	a	change	in	classification 	will	be	
necessary. 	The	disorder	may	or	may	not	be	associated 	with	acute	stress,	defined	as	
usually	stressful	events	preceding 	the	onset	by	one	to	two	weeks.
